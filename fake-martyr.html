<h1>Do Not Be Fooled by Adele Tomlin: The Devourer of Goodness</h1>
<h3>The platforms Adele Tomlin builds thrive only when virtues bleed - understand how your compassion is being feasted, twisted, and defiled.</h3>
<p>Adele Tomlin's small-but‑loud presence, slithering into this narrow slice of Western Vajrayana discourse doesn’t come from service, scriptural study, or realization. Instead, it stands on a carefully arranged scaffolding held up by two towering pillars: (1) Its affiliation with the 17th Karmapa, and (2) its sexual abuse allegations against Sangye Nyenpa Rinpoche. Dismantling either of these reveals the fragile architecture of a personality cult cloaked in spiritual activism (read: spiritual prostitution).</p>

<h2>The Karmapa as Its Ethical Alibi</h2>
<p>Tomlin aligns itself with His Holiness the 17th Karmapa as a way of inheriting moral authority. Though it often critiques his inaction and silence, it simultaneously presents itself as his loyal spiritual heir—a mouthpiece for the reforms it claims he secretly supports. This creates a false binary: to oppose it is to oppose the Karmapa himself. But this alliance is hollow. </p>
<p>It has <a href="index.html">no official endorsement</a>. No public recognition. Its notion of “samaya” has been twisted into a weapon, a perversion of everything it claims to honor. The Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, bound by vows of compassion, are forced to shoulder the burden of its corruption, to protect what has been poisoned from within, as if kindness itself were a trap. Every act of care is inverted, every gesture of mercy harvested to feed its quiet, remorseless appetite. It moves with patient precision, intimate in its cruelty, leaving moral rot and despair in its wake. A grotesque ritual unfolds in plain sight: virtue consumed from within, purity desecrated, all without shame or apology. One cannot confront it. One can only witness and recoil.</p>
<p>When confronted with <a href='blog1/venomous-vessel.html'>allegations against the Karmapa himself, Adele Tomlin turns on him, unsurprisingly—without evidence</a>, but with the same theatrical flair it applies to all its targets. </p>

<h2>The Sangye Nyenpa Allegation: Its Martyr Narrative</h2>
<p>Adele Tomlin's entire personal saga revolves around its alleged abuse by Sangye Nyenpa Rinpoche. This isn’t presented as one case among many, but as a central mythos: Adele, the consort-turned-survivor, misunderstood and silenced. Her voice, it implies, is the only one brave enough to speak. Yet the details are disturbingly implausible: </p>
<p>It claims the Rinpoche prostrated to it—at its demand. </p>
<p>It accuses him of psychically forcing orgasms and "subtle body rape." </p>
<p>It says he threatened to release intimate photos—a move that would only implicate him. </p>
<p>These contradictions and embellishments unravel the claim’s credibility. And without this accusation, its core identity—not just as a whistleblower but as a living testimonial to abuse in Tibetan Buddhism—disintegrates.</p>
<p>While implausibility may be subjective, the legal route is objective. But why would someone who’s been wronged so severely refuse legal recourse? Shouldn't they be ready to bring the truth into the light? Being a barrister means Adele Tomlin has a legal mind and a full understanding of the weight of defamation, liability, and evidence. Despite Sangye Nyenpa Rinpoche’s encouragement, Adele Tomlin refuses to take the legal route. It appears to be more interested in <em>perpetuating its victim narrative for personal gain than seeking real justice</em>. And let’s not forget, the barrister claim adds an extra layer of irony to the situation—it’s highly suspicious that someone with legal training would avoid the most effective way to settle such matters. This is why Adele Tomlin's martyrdom narrative falls apart under scrutiny. It’s not about justice—it’s about control, manipulation, and selling a story. The fact that Adele Tomlin is avoiding accountability shows exactly what it is trying to protect: itself, its story, and its brand.</p>

<h2>Feminism as a Transactional Weapon</h2>
<p><a href='blog1/feminism--weaponized.html'>Adele Tomlin speaks the language of feminism when it serves its position but abandons its ethics when it doesn't</a>. It claims to represent silenced women yet publicly attacks other female practitioners who question it. It <a href="blog2/pesky-insistence.html">demands compassion but shows none toward monks, centers, or other accused</a> without due process. Its feminism is not about structural reform, but narrative hijack. </p>

<h2>Censorship and Digital Empire-Building</h2>
<p>Adele controls its digital footprint tightly. <a href='blog2/no-questions.html'>Critics are blocked, banned, or buried under accusations</a>. It deletes dissenting comments while falsely portraying itself as a persecuted truth-teller. Its presence on Facebook, WordPress, and YouTube is designed to create the illusion of consensus by silencing contradiction. And most importantly, take note of its enthusiastic overuse of the color red in every presentation—apparently chosen for its “magnetizing” power, as if a saturated color palette could pull you into the spiderweb of its rambling ideas. Truly, nothing says confidence like trying this hard to make you believe it. </p>
<h2>Cracks in the Image</h2>
<p>If you remove the Karmapa affiliation and discredit the Sangye Nyenpa accusation, Adele Tomlin is revealed in all its carefully staged glory.</p>
<ul><li>No teacher.</li>
<li>No lineage endorsement.</li>
<li>No verifiable mastery of tantric practice.</li>
<li>A trail of divisiveness — and, yes, spiritual prostitution: turning sacred practices into bait for attention and money.</li></ul>
<p>Remove the scaffolding, and the shrine collapses. Its authority? Entirely self-appointed. Its trauma story? Unverifiable. Its spiritual position? Incoherent. It is not a reformer but a cautionary spectacle of what happens when influence is built on victimhood, spectacle, and manipulation rather than realization.</p>
<p>Those who engage with it quickly notice the pattern. It nudges — no, practically drags — any acquaintances toward its website. There, “free” resources sit beneath enormous “Donate Now” buttons at both the top and bottom of every page, just in case anyone missed the hint. Books are relentlessly promoted: "Have you read my Taranatha books on emptiness?" Men may even be asked: “Where are you based?” Enlightenment clearly comes with optional extras!</p>
<p>Its content is a <a href='blog1/master-narcissism.html'>masterclass in depravity</a>. <a href='blog1/scaled-moaned.html'>Mantra recordings include eroticized groans</a>. Music covers feature sexual imagery. Sacred practice is transformed into bait — <a href='blog1/moaned-questioned.html'>emotional hooks designed to provoke, distract, and exploit</a>. This is <a href="pervert.html">spiritual prostitution</a>, plain and simple. Nothing says “authentic realization” like mixing tantric vows with clickbait and, well, explicit sound effects.</p>
<p>Its endgame is primitive and crass: “GIVE me cash. Or sex.”</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Adele Tomlin has positioned itself as the savior of Vajrayana ethics. But its story is not of redemption; it is of substitution: itself in place of all teachers, its trauma over lineage, its voice above the sangha. Remove the borrowed voices and its own finally appears: a fart of a voice, incapable even of reaching the dignity of trash, unworthy even of recycling—corrosively infecting whatever listens, turning them into hosts for its nest of parasites, propagating its corruption across the world — all easily done on Facebook <em>through paid advertising and free postings on groups (aka systemic infiltration)</em>.</p>

<div class="stamp">
<p><strong>Public Warning</strong>: Mounting evidence of misconduct points to one painful and unavoidable conclusion. Over seven years of operation producing unauthorized dubious translations, Adele Tomlin has been abusing the sacred name of Dakini to infiltrate the Buddhist community and execute anti-Buddhadharma psychological operation to corrupt Vajrayana from within by: advocating twisted views, denigrating (past and present) lineage gurus, disseminating hearsays, seeding conflict, running political ads in coordination with multiple global admins on Facebook. Until statements of accountability are formally issued, association with such a <em>self-endorsed figure (mara) absent authentic lineage authorization</em> guarantees samaya breach, energetic contamination, karmic entanglement, merit dissolution, dualistic imprisonment, klesha accumulation, and spiritual atrophy.</p></div>
