<h1>Lost in Translation: How Adele Tomlin Weaponized a Court Document to Smear the Karmapa</h1>

<blockquote>“Misunderstanding law is forgivable. Misusing it to destroy someone’s life and lineage is not.”</blockquote>


<h2>The Legal Illusion</h2>
<p>When someone who claims to be an ex-barrister misrepresents basic legal principles, red flags should fly. Adele Tomlin — under the name Dakini Translations and Publications — has long portrayed herself as a voice of reason, a victim of abuse, and a passionate advocate for justice. But in a now-notorious Facebook comment, she publicly cited a Canadian court document to reinforce her belief that the 17th Karmapa Ogyen Trinley Dorje fathered a child — without disclosing a key legal disclaimer that the entire document was based on unproven allegations. This post dissects that moment, exposes the manipulation, and reveals the dangers of spiritual distortion disguised as legal expertise.</p>

<h2>The Comment That Revealed Everything</h2>
<p>Here’s Adele Tomlin’s comment, aimed at the admin of a page defending the Karmapa on the sexual allegations:</p>

<blockquote>“If it is true that the Karmapa has a child with Han, would not your slandering her here be totally wrong? The official court papers that were published online… clearly state that the respondent, Dorje, admitted that 1 million CAD were transferred to Han via third parties ‘for the child’. So are you saying the court documents themselves are false? That is a very serious accusation to make of a court of law. Can you prove that?”</blockquote>

<p>Sounds credible… until you actually read the court document.</p>

<h2>The Clause Adele Tomlin Intentionally Left Out</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.bccourts.ca/jdb-txt/sc/21/09/2021BCSC0939cor1.htm">The very same document</a>, at the top of the “Background” section, explicitly states:</p>

<blockquote>“[6] It should be emphasized that this is an application to amend pleadings only. The allegations by the claimant are presumed to be true for the purposes of this application. Those allegations have not been tested in a court of law.”</blockquote>

<p>Let that sink in:</p>

<p>The document does not confirm anything as fact. The statements cited are unverified allegations used to support a procedural motion. Yet Adele Tomlin presents them as if they were admissions of guilt or established truth. This is not a mistake, but intentional framing to mislead.</p>

<p>By consequence, any claims about DNA test confirmation and out-of-court settlements are entirely unsubstantiated. No DNA results have been made public, and Canadian family law ensures such filings remain confidential. Even if someone claims a test was conducted, the sample must be verified and properly documented in court to have any legal or factual weight. Anonymous sources or blogs cannot guarantee this, making such claims scientifically and legally meaningless. Furthermore, the lawsuit was discontinued without prejudice, meaning it was temporarily withdrawn and could be refiled. If a legally binding settlement had occurred, the case would have been discontinued with prejudice, permanently closing the matter. The procedural record therefore unequivocally precludes any notion of settlement or admission of guilt. In short, presenting DNA or settlement claims as fact ignores both the procedural reality and the legal safeguards in place, and is a deliberate attempt to mislead readers by borrowing the veneer of authority from court documents. For the verified legal outcome of the Karmapa case — dismantling the DNA and settlement rumors — see my article <a href="karmapa-no-case.html">The Karmapa and the DNA Rumors: hy Claims of Settlement Don’t Hold Up.</a></p>

<p>This deliberate misrepresentation of procedural facts is not an isolated error — it exemplifies Tomlin’s broader pattern of using selective legal language to fabricate credibility, manipulate perception, and reinforce her narrative against the Karmapa, rather than to inform the public accurately.</p>

<h2>What Kind of Barrister Ignores Legal Basics?</h2>
<p>Adele Tomlin claims to have once worked as a barrister. Yet public records show <a href="barrister-illusion.html">no evidence that she was ever qualified or registered as a barrister</a>. Anyone with basic legal literacy knows that pleadings in such motions are not evidence of guilt. So why would someone pretending to have legal training ignore that? Because the goal isn’t to inform — it’s to persuade readers to adopt a view of the Karmapa as guilty — before any trial, before any rebuttal, before any context. This is trial by narrative, not justice.</p>

<h2>The Psychology of “Presumption of Guilt”</h2>
<p>Adele Tomlin’s tactic relies on confirmation bias:</p>

<ul><li>Present an emotionally loaded story.</li>
<li>Provide a “source” that sounds official.</li>
<li>Omit the parts that undermine the accusation.</li></ul>

<p>Readers who are already unsure or traumatized by scandals in the Buddhist world are easily hooked by this method. They believe they are reading truth, when in fact they’re absorbing narrative framing designed to bypass critical thinking.</p>

<h2>Why Invoke the Law at All?</h2>
<p>Here’s the deeper question:</p>
<p>If Adele Tomlin is so confident in her own spiritual insight, why does she keep appealing to state law, civil courts, and court gossip? Because her true goal is not clarity, but character assassination — using any means necessary.</p>
<p>When dharma is not enough to discredit a guru, she borrows from secular systems to erode trust. And when those systems don’t support her narrative, she cherry-picks and edits until they do.</p>

<h2>The Hidden Motive: Justifying Her Own Sexual Accusation Against Sangye Nyenpa Rinpoche</h2>
<p>This misrepresentation of the Karmapa may serve another purpose:</p>
<p>Adele Tomlin has publicly claimed to be a victim of abuse by Sangye Nyenpa Rinpoche. But with no corroborating evidence, no case filed, and no public support, her claim stands on shaky ground. By casting the Karmapa — an even more public figure — as also abusive or morally suspect, she reinforces her own credibility by association.</p>

<blockquote>“If he’s guilty, then surely I’m telling the truth too.”</blockquote>

<p>It’s a deeply manipulative triangulation that uses one spiritual leader’s reputation as a shield for her own narrative.</p>

<h2>Closing Thoughts: Truth Requires Discernment</h2>
<p>This is not about protecting one person. This is about protecting integrity — of the Dharma, of spiritual traditions, and of our own capacity to reason clearly. Adele Tomlin’s misuse of court documents reveals something deeper than legal ignorance: a conscious attempt to deceive, wrapped in just enough formalism to fool the casual reader. This is not the action of a victim seeking justice, but the behavior of a <a href="venomous-vessel.html">venomous vessel</a> driven to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUe-kFqM9dY">overthrow Vajrayana Buddhism.</a></p>

<h2>References</h2>
<p>Adele Tomlin has a documented pattern of silencing critique by forcing platforms to delete entire blogs. Readers may ask themselves — what kind of scholar prefers erasure over rebuttal? The answer is obvious: on who fears her own words being held up to scrutiny.</p>

<p><strong>Public Warning</strong>: Mounting evidence of misconduct points to one painful and unavoidable conclusion. Over seven years of operation producing unauthorized dubious translations, Adele Tomlin has been abusing the sacred name of Dakini to infiltrate the Buddhist community and execute anti-Buddhadharma psychological operation to corrupt Vajrayana from within by: advocating twisted views, denigrating (past and present) lineage gurus, disseminating hearsays, seeding conflict, running political ads in coordination with multiple global admins on Facebook. Until statements of accountability are formally issued, association with such a <em>self-endorsed figure (mara) absent authentic lineage authorization</em> guarantees samaya breach, energetic contamination, karmic entanglement, merit dissolution, dualistic imprisonment, klesha accumulation, and spiritual atrophy.</p></div>
