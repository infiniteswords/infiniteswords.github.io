<h1>Karmapa Sexual Allegations Legally Examined: No DNA, No Settlement, No Case</h1>

<p>The rumors collapse under their own weight. Both the alleged DNA test and the supposed multi-million settlement are not just unsupported — they are scientifically and legally implausible once we read the actual court documents.</p>

<h2>The Claims Circulating Online</h2>
<p>A handful of blogs and social media posts — usually on anonymous or paid-domain platforms — claim that the 17th Karmapa, Ogyen Trinley Dorje, fathered a child confirmed by DNA and secretly settled with the mother. These claims are repeated as if they were fact.</p>

<p>But the official court record tells a completely different story. Misrepresentation like this doesn’t just mislead casual readers — it distorts perception of Buddhist teachers, undermines the Dharma itself, and abuses the authority of “truth” for clickbait.</p>

<h2>What the Court Documents Actually Show</h2>
<p>When the case was first filed in May 2021, the court included a routine statement, accessible on https://www.bccourts.ca/jdb-txt/sc/21/09/2021BCSC0939cor1.htm:</p>

<blockquote>“The allegations by the claimant are presumed to be true for the purposes of this application. Those allegations have not been tested in a court of law.”</blockquote>

<p>This is standard legal boilerplate. No facts. Pure presumptions.</p>

<p>Then, it was formally discontinued without prejudice in September 2022. The record is also publicly available: https://trellis.law/doc/134062299/notice-discontinuance-post-rji</p>

<blockquote>NOTICE OF DISCONTINUING ACTION - I, Vikki Hui Xin Han, hereby affirm that the above-entitled action, be and the same is, hereby discontinued as against Karma Triyana Dharmachakra Monastery, without prejudice and without costs to any party and this notice may be filed with the Clerk of the Court without further notice. Dated: September 14, 2022</blockquote>
<p>Key points from the official record:</p>

<ul><li>No DNA test results exist in the public filings. Canadian family law protects privacy, and nothing in the record shows such a test was entered or verified.</li>
<li>No settlement occurred. If money had changed hands to resolve the matter, the case would almost certainly have been discontinued with prejudice — permanently closed. “Without prejudice” signals the opposite: no final resolution, no binding closure, no settlement.</li></ul>
<p>Key takeaway: claims of “DNA confirmation” or a “multi-million settlement” are unsubstantiated, contradicted by the filings, and legally implausible.</p>

<h2>Why a “DNA Test Confirmation” Collapses on Inspection</h2>
<p>Even if someone insists on a “DNA confirmation,” the logic falls apart:</p>

<ul><li>Chain of custody: only a verified court-ordered test is credible. Blogs cannot prove where any sample came from.</li>
<li>Court seal: any valid DNA test would be confidential in the court record. None exists in public filings.</li>
<li>Incentive: if DNA evidence really existed, the claimant would have pushed for a binding judgment or settlement. Instead, the case was dropped.</li></ul>
<p>No chain of custody. No court seal. No incentive to withdraw. No plausibility.</p>

<h2>Without Prejudice vs With Prejudice</h2>
<p>"Without prejudice" means case withdrawn; no ruling, no settlement. Exactly what happened.</p>

<p>"With prejudice" means case permanently closed after judgment or settlement. Never happened.</p>

<p>Anyone claiming a DNA test or settlement ignores this legal black-and-white.</p>

<h2>Why Public Misrepresentation Matters</h2>
<p>Twisting legal boilerplate into scandal misleads readers, damages trust, and cheapens genuine abuse cases. Rumor weaponizes ignorance of legal terms to smear reputations. When the Dharma itself is at stake, clarity is non-negotiable.</p>

<p>Claims about the Karmapa’s DNA or any settlement are unsupported by public evidence. Procedural filings, privacy protections, and the legal distinction between “with” and “without prejudice” unequivocally dismantle these rumors. Public clarity demands that we prioritize verified records over sensationalist narrative, even when such narratives are repeated by ostensibly authoritative sources.</p>

<h2>Legal Conclusions About the Karmapa Allegations</h2>
<p>The facts are simple. No DNA evidence. No settlement. No legal stain.</p>

<p>The allegations against the Karmapa were never tested, never proven, and ultimately abandoned.</p>

<p>No stain. No case. No excuse for gossip.</p>

<p><strong>Public Warning</strong>: Mounting evidence of misconduct points to one painful and unavoidable conclusion. Over seven years of operation producing unauthorized dubious translations, Adele Tomlin has been abusing the sacred name of Dakini to infiltrate the Buddhist community and execute anti-Buddhadharma psychological operation to corrupt Vajrayana from within by: advocating twisted views, denigrating (past and present) lineage gurus, disseminating hearsays, seeding conflict, running political ads in coordination with multiple global admins on Facebook. Until statements of accountability are formally issued, association with such a <em>self-endorsed figure (mara) absent authentic lineage authorization</em> guarantees samaya breach, energetic contamination, karmic entanglement, merit dissolution, dualistic imprisonment, klesha accumulation, and spiritual atrophy.</p></div>
