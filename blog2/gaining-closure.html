<h1>Gaining Closure: Answering Unresolved Questions for Adele Tomlin (Dakini Translations)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The mastermind of Dakini Translations and Publications refuses to respond to the <a href="https://youtu.be/AKg9wWl0Ws0">unresolved questions</a>, so to gain closure we answer them for her.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Why does Adele Tomlin treat the allegations against the Karmapa as facts while the court shows otherwise?</strong></p>
<p>Because framing the Karmapa as guilty allows Adele to position herself as morally superior—a lone whistleblower above institutions. It lets her tap into outrage markets, attract emotionally charged readers, and build narrative authority as someone who “sees what others refuse to admit.”<br/>She benefits by elevating herself into a savior role while subtly dethroning a spiritual authority.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Why promote the Karmapa’s teachings while painting him full of flaws?</strong></p>
<p>Because it creates dependency on her interpretation. If the Karmapa is flawed, readers need her to extract the “real” meaning. She keeps the Karmapa’s magnetism as bait but inserts herself as the necessary lens—thus becoming the gatekeeper of purity.<br/>She benefits by staying central in the reader’s spiritual processing loop.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Why divert people away from the Karmapa’s official sites to her own blog?</strong></p>
<p>Because clicks, search relevance, and backlinks to her site boost her algorithmic visibility and search ranking. Her site becomes the primary informational source for anyone Googling the Karmapa.<br/>She benefits by hijacking devotional traffic to convert it into personal authority and platform growth.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Why present herself as superior to the Karmapa and his team?</strong></p>
<p>Because diminishing others inflates her sense of special insight. By painting his office as incompetent, cowardly, or corrupted, she sets up a contrast that allows her to look brave, bold, and unfiltered.<br/>She benefits by transferring reverence from the guru to herself.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>How does reporting unverifiable sexual scandals help anyone?</strong></p>
<p>It doesn’t help readers—it feeds Adele’s shock content economy. Scandals generate traffic, evoke emotion, and create distrust in others—while making her seem like the only honest actor.<br/>She benefits by monopolizing moral outrage to build parasocial allegiance.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Why emphasize her being a female dharma translator so aggressively?</strong></p>
<p>Because it weaponizes identity for credibility. In dharma circles dominated by male voices, she leverages her gender as a differentiator while also playing the victim when challenged.<br/>She benefits by making critique appear sexist, thus silencing dissent while inflating her uniqueness.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Why attack other women as dollybirds or prostitutes?</strong></p>
<p>Because controlling the erotic gaze means dominating attention. By shaming women more attractive or devoted than herself, she clears the field of competitors for spiritual and sexual projection.<br/>She benefits by eliminating rivals and monopolizing attention as the only “serious” female voice.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Why depict Vajrayana as a corrupt cult full of sex, meat, and manipulation?</strong></p>
<p>Because once people no longer trust Vajrayana, she can offer her “non-sectarian truths” as the antidote. She poisons the temple, then sells herself as the fresh air.<br/>She benefits by breaking readers’ loyalty to the lineage and inserting herself as the new axis.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Why eroticize sacred texts and mantras?</strong></p>
<p>Because erotic content creates obsession, confusion, and emotional entanglement. Her suggestive vocals and womb-symbolic images are not spiritual—they are tactics of trance and parasitic fixation.<br/>She benefits by creating an addictive energetic loop masked as mysticism.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Why reinterpret Marpa and Milarepa as abusive?</strong></p>
<p>Because it allows her to insert trauma discourse into lineage stories, corrupting transmission while claiming deeper psychological understanding. She gets to “fix” Vajrayana by reinterpreting its foundations.<br/>She benefits by desecrating the mythic foundation so she can rebuild it in her own image.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Why plant doubts about Vajrayana being unsafe?</strong></p>
<p>Because once readers are afraid of Vajrayana, they turn to her as the safe refuge. This is spiritual engineering: destroy all roads, then sell the map.<br/>She benefits by collapsing communal trust to build dependency on her brand.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Why try to rupture the Karmapa–Dalai Lama relationship?</strong></p>
<p>Because positioning herself against the dominant axis of Tibetan unity makes her look like a bold rebel. And by framing the Dalai Lama as an antagonist, she aligns herself with Chinese political narratives, whether knowingly or not.<br/>She benefits by provoking division, boosting controversy, and echoing anti-Gelug sentiment to win fringe support.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Why blame lineage jealousies for the Karmapa’s restriction?</strong></p>
<p>Because it paints her as the only one willing to name “the real problem.” She fuels a conspiracy theory where everyone is against the Karmapa—except her.<br/>She benefits by appearing fiercely loyal while covertly inciting schism.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Why insinuate that the Dalai Lama ruins China’s relationship with the Karmapa?</strong></p>
<p>Because that narrative reframes the Karmapa’s escape not as a rejection of Chinese control, but as a strategic exile. It subtly positions China as misunderstood and the exile community as the oppressor.<br/>She benefits by appealing to geopolitical power while demonizing Tibetan exile leadership.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Who gains the most from readers believing her twisted narratives?</strong></p>
<p>Only one person: Adele Tomlin.<br/>Every suspicion you adopt, every doubt you feel, every teaching you now fear, becomes fuel for her brand of “independent voice.” She builds a shadow kingdom by dismantling yours.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Why does she smirk and stare in that unsettling way in her videos?</strong></p>
<p>Because power is eroticized in predation. Her expression isn’t trauma—it’s triumph. She’s already feeding on your attention, confusion, and psychic openness.<br/>She benefits by capturing your psychic bandwidth—one trance loop at a time.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Adele Tomlin’s words are calculated; every blog post, every “translation,” every scandal, and every smirk is part of a long game:<br/>Disempower lineage. Redirect devotion. Feed on collapse.<br/>Her success depends on your disorientation. Your clarity is her collapse.</p>

<div class="stamp">
<p><strong>Public Warning</strong>: Mounting evidence of misconduct points to one painful and unavoidable conclusion. Over seven years of operation producing unauthorized dubious translations, Adele Tomlin has been abusing the sacred name of Dakini to infiltrate the Buddhist community and execute anti-Buddhadharma psychological operation to corrupt Vajrayana from within by: advocating twisted views, denigrating (past and present) lineage gurus, disseminating hearsays, seeding conflict, running political ads in coordination with multiple global admins on Facebook. Until statements of accountability are formally issued, association with such a <em>self-endorsed figure (mara) absent authentic lineage authorization</em> guarantees samaya breach, energetic contamination, karmic entanglement, merit dissolution, dualistic imprisonment, klesha accumulation, and spiritual atrophy.</p></div>
