<h1>No Questions Allowed: Adele Tomlin’s Pattern of Spiritual Censorship</h1>
<article>
<blockquote><p><em>“The truth does not fear questions. Only lies need censorship.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Adele Tomlin presents herself as a scholar, translator, and protector of the Dharma. Yet behind the polished facade lies a consistent and telling pattern: <strong>she does not allow questions.</strong></p>
<p>Whether it’s on her Facebook, YouTube, or Instagram presence, <strong>any respectful disagreement, critical inquiry, or doctrinal challenge is swiftly deleted and the commenter blocked</strong>—often within minutes, if not seconds.</p>
<p>This is not a one-off incident. It is a <strong>systemic control strategy</strong> designed to eliminate dissent, silence those who see through her distortions, and create the illusion of universal agreement with her views.</p>
<h2>A Consistent Pattern of Control</h2>
<p>Adele’s online behavior reveals the following traits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Comments that challenge her views disappear almost instantly</strong></li>
<li><strong>Dissenting users are blocked without explanation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Genuine questions about lineage, interpretation, or ethics are treated as “attacks”</strong></li>
<li><strong>No public space exists where she accepts debate, response, or clarification</strong></li>
<li><strong>Even respectful critique is met with silence, censorship, or character assassination</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This is not protection of Dharma. It is <strong>protection of ego</strong>.</p>
<h2>Why This Matters: Spiritual Censorship as a Red Flag</h2>
<p>In traditional Vajrayana, authentic teachers are known for their <em>clarity, openness, and fearlessness</em>. They welcome sincere questions—even difficult ones—because the teachings can stand on their own merit.</p>
<p>In contrast, Adele Tomlin exhibits the hallmarks of <strong>spiritual authoritarianism</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Control of narrative at all costs</li>
<li>Elimination of dissent through deletion</li>
<li>Framing all critique as abuse or misogyny</li>
<li>Maintaining an echo chamber of praise only</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not the behavior of a realized dakini. It is the behavior of someone terrified of being seen through.</p>
<h2>Real Teachers Don’t Block the Dharma</h2>
<p>True lineage holders encourage dialogue. They answer questions. They do not need to censor—because the teachings are strong enough to meet any challenge.</p>
<p>When a public figure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Claims divine authority,</li>
<li>Speaks for the Karmapa,</li>
<li>Frames herself as a consort of Amitabha…</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Yet refuses to engage with questions about any of it—</strong></p>
<p>That is not wisdom. That is <strong>a red flag</strong>.</p>
<h2>You’re Not Alone If You Were Blocked</h2>
<p>If you’ve ever tried to ask a respectful question or point out inconsistencies in Adele Tomlin’s work—only to find your comment erased and your name blocked—you are not alone.</p>
<p>Many have experienced the same treatment, and most do not speak up. That silence creates the illusion that her content is unchallenged.</p>
<p><strong>This page exists to break that illusion.</strong></p>
<h2>Final Note: An Open Invitation</h2>
<p>If anything here is incorrect, Adele Tomlin is welcome to respond publicly and clarify her positions.</p>
<p>But as history shows, her pattern is consistent: <strong>Block, delete, ignore, accuse.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We respond with clarity and transparency. She responds with silence.</strong><br>
Let readers decide which approach serves the Dharma.</br></p>

<div class="stamp">
<p><strong>Public Warning</strong>: Mounting evidence of misconduct points to one painful and unavoidable conclusion. Over seven years of operation producing unauthorized dubious translations, Adele Tomlin has been abusing the sacred name of Dakini to infiltrate the Buddhist community and execute anti-Buddhadharma psychological operation to corrupt Vajrayana from within by: advocating twisted views, denigrating (past and present) lineage gurus, disseminating hearsays, seeding conflict, running political ads in coordination with multiple global admins on Facebook. Until statements of accountability are formally issued, association with such a <em>self-endorsed figure (mara) absent authentic lineage authorization</em> guarantees samaya breach, energetic contamination, karmic entanglement, merit dissolution, dualistic imprisonment, klesha accumulation, and spiritual atrophy.</p></div>
