<h1>Reader Mindstate Checklist: Before &amp; After Encountering Dakini Translations</h1>

<h3>Usage Instructions for Readers:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pause:</strong> Before internalizing, ask yourself the <em>Pattern Flag / Meta-Trigger</em> questions to check for narrative manipulation.</li>
<li><strong>Reflect:</strong> Identify which mental poisons may be activated and consciously disengage them.</li>
<li><strong>Recenter:</strong> Return to Dharma principles – equanimity, compassion, discernment.</li>
<li><strong>Resist:</strong> Avoid spreading content that triggers disempowerment or division.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reader Self-Defense Script: Recognize &amp; Resist Dakini Translations’ Narrative Trap</h2>
<p>Before you dive in, ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Am I being pushed to hate or distrust without full evidence?</li>
<li>Is simple blame replacing complex truth?</li>
<li>Are normal human actions framed as betrayal?</li>
<li>Am I slipping into anger, envy, pride, or confusion?</li>
<li>Is suspicion replacing inquiry and faith?</li>
<li>Am I caught in an emotional loop, not a thoughtful process?</li>
</ul>
<p>If yes, pause. This is a signal: the narrative is triggering your <strong>Five Poisons</strong> – hatred, greed, jealousy, pride, and delusion – feeding a toxic cycle designed to fracture trust and disrupt your clarity.</p>
<p>Choose instead to <strong>anchor in discernment and compassion</strong>. Protect your mind and practice by refusing reactive engagement with divisive content.</p>

<div class="stamp">
<p><strong>Public Warning</strong>: Mounting evidence of misconduct points to one painful and unavoidable conclusion. Over seven years of operation producing unauthorized dubious translations, Adele Tomlin has been abusing the sacred name of Dakini to infiltrate the Buddhist community and execute anti-Buddhadharma psychological operation to corrupt Vajrayana from within by: advocating twisted views, denigrating (past and present) lineage gurus, disseminating hearsays, seeding conflict, running political ads in coordination with multiple global admins on Facebook. Until statements of accountability are formally issued, association with such a <em>self-endorsed figure (mara) absent authentic lineage authorization</em> guarantees samaya breach, energetic contamination, karmic entanglement, merit dissolution, dualistic imprisonment, klesha accumulation, and spiritual atrophy.</p></div>
