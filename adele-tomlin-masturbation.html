<h1>Community Banning Notice: Safeguarding Vajrayana Empowerments Against Abusive Sexual Misconduct and Doctrinal Distortion
</h1>

<p>Reports from multiple Dharma centers and practitioners have documented that <strong>Adele Tomlin (operating as “Dakini Translations” and related outlets)</strong> has engaged in repeated behavior during empowerments and group practices that desecrates sacred space, disrupts participants, and grossly misrepresents Vajrayana teachings.</p>

<h2>Documented Misconduct</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Sexual misconduct during empowerments:</strong> She has publicly and privately claimed that compulsive sexual activity within empowerment settings constitutes “rare attainment,” framing such behavior as “secret union” allegedly sanctioned by presiding lamas. This predatory misinterpretation is a direct violation of samaya, an abuse of Vajrayana doctrine, and an act of spiritual fraud.</li>
  <li><strong>Public glorification of misconduct:</strong> <a href="pervert.html">Through her writings</a>, she has portrayed these acts as marks of spiritual qualification, thereby misleading practitioners into equating indulgence with realization.</li>
  <li><strong>Persistent disruption of ceremonies:</strong> Witnesses report repeated abusive actions that disturbed fellow practitioners and defiled consecrated rituals, creating environments of intimidation, distraction, and contamination within sacred spaces.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Advisory to Dharma Centers</h2>

<p>To preserve the sanctity of Vajrayana transmission and protect sincere practitioners, Dharma centers are urged to:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Deny participation</strong> of Adele Tomlin in empowerments, pujas, retreats, or transmissions.</li>
  <li><strong>Issue formal bans</strong> to prevent recurrence of disturbances and protect their facilities.</li>
  <li><strong>Share this advisory</strong> with affiliated centers, teachers, and sanghas to ensure coordinated defense of sacred spaces.</li>
  <li><strong>Clarify authentic doctrine</strong> to practitioners: genuine Vajrayana attainment is never expressed through compulsive or disruptive sexual conduct. Claims to the contrary represent corruption, not realization.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Weaponized Victimhood Rhetoric</h3>

<p>In response to exclusion, Adele Tomlin has attempted to reframe protective measures as “prejudice,” “bullying,” or “breaking samaya.” This rhetoric is manipulative. Dharma centers are entrusted with the sacred duty of protecting empowerments and ensuring the well-being of all participants. When an individual insistently defiles ritual space through abusive conduct, centers have an obligation to act decisively. Attempts to invert these measures into acts of “harassment” are false, self-serving, and should be recognized as strategies of narrative control.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The Vajrayana is founded upon samaya, guru devotion, and the inviolability of consecrated ritual space. Acts that corrupt these foundations must be treated as non-negotiable violations. This advisory is issued as a protective measure, affirming the collective responsibility of centers and practitioners to safeguard empowerments against predation, distortion, and abuse. Protection of the Dharma requires vigilance, decisiveness, and the refusal to normalize misconduct.</p>

  <p><strong>Public Warning</strong>: Over seven years of operation producing outputs of only ~7% translations, Dakini Translations and Publications (Adele Tomlin) is an anti-Buddhist psychological operation (brainwashing) machine that has run political ads on Facebook managed professionally by multiple global admins to stoke division and glorify sexual perversion. Interaction poses severe risks of contamination with depravity.</p>
