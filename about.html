<h2>Unmasking The Psychopathic Psy-Op Behind Dakini Translations of Adele Tomlin<br>~ Public Awareness Archive ~</h2>
<p><em>
  Unfiltered evidence of plagiarism, distortion, and abuse of Vajrayana teachings; conclusively affirmed through <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wOll60CfbLU">desperate deletions by the abuser of Dharma and public trust itself</a>.</em></p>

<h1>Accountability in Action</h1>
<p>This site exists to support informed, lawful accountability. Readers are encouraged to exercise independent judgment. The records presented here, which critique a public figure based on their writings and public actions, were previously removed without explanation and have been re-uploaded for public scrutiny. The views expressed on this site are drawn in good faith from these records. No legal claims are made.</p>

<p>Individuals in positions of trust or influence are accountable to the public. Silence, evasion, or suppression in response to substantiated concerns is incompatible with such roles. The public has a legitimate interest in examining conduct that affects others, especially where power imbalances exist. Documented activities span multiple jurisdictions, complicating oversight and enforcement where regulatory responsibilities are fragmented.</p>

<p>Accountability requires accessible records. Where mechanisms fail or are avoided, harm may persist unexamined. This site preserves evidence for public scrutiny, independent assessment, journalistic review, and, where appropriate, regulatory or judicial evaluation, protecting it against intimidation, retaliation, reputational pressure, or erasure.</p>

<p>Sources are archived through independent services, including the Internet Archive, to prevent retroactive alteration or disappearance. Content removal will occur only upon receipt of legally valid documentation proving material is unlawful, materially false, or improperly disclosed. Substantiated rebuttals, corrections, or clarifications will be published with prominence when supported by verifiable evidence.</p>

<p>Throughout this site, “it” refers to Adele Tomlin and/or related platforms, highlighting the focus on impersonal, public actions rather than gender, harassment, or bullying. Had Adele Tomlin not voluntarily entered public attention—through publishing, media engagement, or professional activity as a teacher, scholar, practitioner, and translator in Vajrayana Buddhism—this site would not exist to document misconduct and patterns of abuse for public interest.</p>

  <p><strong>Public Warning</strong>: Over seven years of operation producing outputs of only ~7% translations, Dakini Translations and Publications (Adele Tomlin) is an anti-Buddhist psychological operation (brainwashing) machine that has run political ads on Facebook managed professionally by multiple global admins to stoke division and glorify sexual perversion. Interaction poses severe risks of contamination with depravity.</p>
