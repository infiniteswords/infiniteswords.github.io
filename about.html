<h1>Public Accountability by Preserving Public Records</h1>

<p>Owning several websites and publications, Adele Tomlin tries to position itself as a private individual, expecting the world to leave it alone while avoiding responsibility for the global platforms it operates. it regularly claims harassment and discrimination, framing itself as a lone "white, beautiful, and talented" teacher-scholar-practitioner-translator in Vajrayana Buddhism. Such claims are often leveled against critics who question its actions, dismissing them as "anti-feminist," "sexist" or "jealous," while deflecting from the real issues at hand: its public conduct and decisions. Framing legitimate critique as "defamation" or "personal attacks," especially when that critique is rooted in evidence from its public works, is deceptive at best and evasive at worst. <a href="blog1/feminism-weaponized.html">Feminism is twistedly weaponized to shield against accountability</a>. The fact that it loudly claims to be a qualified barrister (are you even capable of arguing with one?) is even more damning: Why is it unable to take full accountability for its actions, defend itself properly, address public concerns professionally, but instead "defames itself" (no haters needed) repeatedly with primitive countermoves of <a href="blog1/unresolved-questions.html">fear through silencing attempts</a> and <a href="blog1/scaled-moaned.html">lust through defiling sacred spaces</a>? Why would Adele Tomlin assume the higher minds propelling questioning can be effectively shut down (better yet, annihilated!) by activating the lower parts of the body? Adele Tomlin clearly demands attention so desperately to a perverted extreme, going so far as to embrace indecency with its various low-effort maneuvers. This site will give it fully just that: <strong>public attention that comes with full accountability.</strong></p>

<p>This site can potentially be framed as harassment, by Adele Tomlin. If our so-called "harassment," or however you want to call it, would stop mitigating public harms, should it be stopped? Or should we all become complicit by keeping silence and support Adele's ongoing public abuse? <strong>Harassment that harms individuals should be stopped</strong>. How has our "harassment" harmed anyone but <em>inconvenienced</em> Adele Tomlin in enacting its vicious plots against Vajrayana Buddhist fellows? By 'inconvenienced,' we mean readers who access our materials will pause, verify, and think for themselves. If Adele's actions have indeed been benefiting the public and we have defamed or harassed Adele unfairly, wouldn't the public see through the baselessness of our assertions and dismiss our voice anyway? Who are we to have the superpower to convince a benefited follower of Adele otherwise? Why would Adele need to remove our content? Why the need to intervene the public right in exercizing judgment? Why is Adele certain that the public will invariably agree with our voice that removal becomes compulsory? Unless of course, that our voice aligns fully with the public voice. Our interest fully aligns with the public interest. And indeed, based on our study of Adele's public-facing works, it has been systemically <em>harming</em> fellow Buddhist practitioners. Adele Tomlin can never be harassed, as evidenced by its incessant acquisition of new website domains. It is the one who keeps harassing the public, or shall we say, <em>ensnaring</em> and <em>abusing</em> the public in every way (un)imaginable through its various <a href="blog1/weaponized-morality.html">perception-engineering tricks to mislead, distort, and disrupt authentic Vajrayana study and practice for more than a decade since at least 2012, according to an insider</a>. Our study of public-facing works (harassment in the eyes of Adele alone) aims to empower the public to exercise their own judgment and make decisions accordingly. Whether our critical analysis is of any value should rest entirely on the public's judgment — a right no one (definitely not Adele) should take away. Our focus is never on Adele; it should quit seeing the world revolving around its ego. Our focus is on the preserving the public access to authentic Vajrayana study and practice. When you truly benefit from the precious Vajrayana teachings passed down by lineage masters, you feel deeply indebted that there is nothing you can do to repay their kindness other than to preserve their teachings intact, ensuring the public derive similarly full benefit without distortion.</p>

<p>This site exists to ensure that accountability is <strong>inescapable</strong>. We restore what is rightfully the public’s — critiques of Adele Tomlin’s misconduct and abuse in Vajrayana Buddhism based on its own public works and actions — to ensure transparency, scrutiny, and public review. They were previously removed from three different public blogs with no legal justification provided and are republished here to ensure public access. Selected articles are reconstructed from available backups since some were not archived, or the archived version are outdated. The views presented on this site are drawn in good faith from publicly available records and republished content, and are intended for critical analysis. No legal claims are made. Content is preserved unless removal is required by a valid legal order or statutory obligation, in which case the removal and its basis will be documented. Verifiable responses, corrections, or rebutals supported by primary evidence will also be logged and indexed with the same visibility as the original records.</p>

<p>Throughout this site, the pronoun “it” refers to Adele Tomlin or associated platforms, emphasizing its impersonal public actions rather than gender or personal characteristics. Had Adele Tomlin not voluntarily entered public life through publishing, media engagement, and professional activity in Vajrayana Buddhism, this site would not exist to support <em>independent scrutiny</em> by restoring what would otherwise be inaccessible. We believe that the public deserves the right to access public-interest materials to draw their independent conclusions.</p>

<div class="stamp">
<p><strong>Public Warning</strong>: Mounting evidence of misconduct points to one painful and unavoidable conclusion. Over seven years of operation producing unauthorized dubious translations, Adele Tomlin has been abusing the sacred name of Dakini to infiltrate the Buddhist community and execute anti-Buddhadharma psychological operation to corrupt Vajrayana from within by: advocating twisted views, denigrating (past and present) lineage gurus, disseminating hearsays, seeding conflict, running political ads in coordination with multiple global admins on Facebook. Until statements of accountability are formally issued, association with such a <em>self-endorsed figure (mara) absent authentic lineage authorization</em> guarantees samaya breach, energetic contamination, karmic entanglement, merit dissolution, dualistic imprisonment, klesha accumulation, and spiritual atrophy.</p></div>
