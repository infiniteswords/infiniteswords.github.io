    <h1>Unauthorized Appropriation of the Karmapa‚Äôs Teachings by Dakini Translations of Adele Tomlin</h1>
    <p>
      The teachings of His Holiness the 17th Karmapa Ogyen Trinley Dorje are sacred transmissions, carefully published to preserve accuracy, lineage authority, and authentic transmission. Adele Tomlin‚Äôs platform, <em>Dakini Translations</em>, undermines this by lifting transcripts without authorization, reframing them through personal commentary, and redirecting readers to its own website. Dakini Translations presents itself as a Dharma translation initiative. In reality, it operates as a malicious apparatus where official lineage teachings are appropriated, reframed through biased interpretation, and leveraged to enhance its own authority. <em>Is this a translation archive or a distortion engine?</em>
    </p>

      <h2>Unauthorized Republishing: A Fraud Disguised As Self-Appointed Translator</h2>
      <p>Without authorization of any form, Adele Tomlin reposts the Karmapa‚Äôs teachings, stripped of source attribution, disclaimers, or disclosure.  Verification is straightforward: readers can open any teaching on Dakini Translations and observe that there is no credit to the official Karmapa Office, no notice that these postings are unauthorized, and no disclosure that the presentation is personal commentary. <em>Is this still called Dharma transmission or unlicensed appropriation?</em>
      </p>

      <h2>Plagiarism and Copyright Violation</h2>
      <p>
        By reproducing official transcripts without permission or citation, Adele Tomlin who claims itself an ex-lawyer engages blatantly in plagiarism and copyright infringement. Anyone can cross-check its postings with official publications on <a href="https://aryakshema.com" target="_blank">aryakshema.com</a>. The overlap is undeniable; the absence of attribution is total.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is outright misappropriation. This is blatant theft of lineage material. A barbaric move that can only be made by the uneducated; but here in our unprecedented case, by a shameless mara proclaiming itself as an ex-lawyer scholar-translator-practitioner!
      </p>

      <h2>Primed Bias Before Transcripts: Deliberate Distortion</h2>
      <p>
        Before presenting the Karmapa‚Äôs actual words, Adele Tomlin injects personal interpretation, framing readers‚Äô perceptions with judgment and bias. Its 'personal observations' consistently precede the official transcript, conditioning readers to view the teachings through its prejudiced lens. <em>A deliberate distortion, never any faithful transmission!</em></p>

 

      <h2>Sectarian Incitement and Lineage Targeting</h2>
      <p>
        Beyond unauthorized republication, Adele Tomlin consistently frames historical events and Karmapa teachings to generate animosity against specific Buddhist lineages, including the Dalai Lama institution, Gelugpas, Sakyapas, Nyingmapas, and even the Karmapa Thaye Dorje.  It selectively presents historical events‚Äîsuch as Mongol-Gelugpa involvement in Tibet‚Äîand injects biased commentary, priming readers to interpret these events as proof of wrongdoing by the target lineages. By combining authoritative citations with its personal framing, it amplifies distrust and hostility among its audience. <em>This is deliberate sectarian manipulation, not historical scholarship.</em> The bias in its writings is consistent, systematic, and engineered to turn followers against one another.
      </p>

      <h2>False Image vs. Actual Structure</h2>
      <p>Adele Tomlin claims Dakini Translations is a sole-authored, female-founded translation resource. Facebook‚Äôs Page Transparency reveals the reality: five administrators in India, the UK, Thailand, and France, with a history of political advertisements. This is publicly verifiable: open the Dakini Translations Facebook page, click <em>About</em>, then <em>Page Transparency</em>. The claimed identity is fabricated; the structure is concealed. What is marketed as a one-woman Dharma service is, in fact, a coordinated operation to disseminate anti-Buddha-Dharma propaganda.</p>
        <p>More astonishingly, an audit of its 899 posts spanning 7 years of operation reveals only 7% translations, 93% being polemics, gossips, etc. Dakini Translations is merely a facade to infiltrate the Buddhist circles to propagate anti-Dharma narratives, specifically <em>hatred and sexual indulgence that serve nothing but to block engagement with the higher minds</em>.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Unauthorized appropriation of lineage teachings is unacceptable. When seeking authentic Dharma, always verify official sources and beware individuals who misrepresent and republish without transparency. Protecting the integrity of the lineage is a shared responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        The repeated framing of Dakini Translations as the work of ‚Äúone woman‚Äù is a shield: any critique is reframed as harassment of a vulnerable individual. The measurable harms ‚Äî plagiarism, distortion, and systematic undermining of lineage trust ‚Äî are structural, not at all personal. The shield protects the remorseless operator; the public unfairly suffers from the consequences of its reckless operations. Such a malicious predator whose sole mission is to harm the public through systemic brainwashing deserves no space anywhere, especially in our pure Buddhist communities.</p>

  <p>Irrefutability leaves only one escape: deletion.<br> What was erased becomes permanent, indisputable proof of confession.

  <p><strong>Public Warning</strong>: Dakini Translations and Publications, authored by Adele Tomlin, presents itself as a solo Vajrayana translation platform. In reality, it is run by multiple global administrators and engages in political activity. An audit of ~900 posts over 7 years shows only ~7% translations, many of which contain editorial additions, commentary, or polemical framing. Engagement is strongly discouraged, except with utmost vigilance, skepticism, and independent verification.</p>
