<h1>Unauthorized Appropriation of the Karmapa’s Teachings by Dakini Translations (Adele Tomlin)</h1> <p> His Holiness the 17th Karmapa Ogyen Trinley Dorje’s teachings are sacred transmissions, preserved with precision to ensure accuracy and lineage integrity. Adele Tomlin openly claims that its website, <em>Dakini Translations</em>, offers its own devotional “retranslations” of the Karmapa’s teachings, brazenly competing with the official websites to draw in followers. In reality, this practice amounts to <strong>unauthorized appropriation and distortion</strong>: transcripts are lifted from official publications, reframed with personal commentary, and redistributed under its name. What is presented as “retranslation” is in fact the misrepresentation of lineage teachings, engineered to replace the Karmapa’s authentic voice with its own. <em>Is this Dharma preservation or calculated Buddhadharma corruption?</em> </p>

<h2>Unauthorized Republishing: A Fraud Disguised as Translation</h2> <p>Without authorization of any kind, Adele Tomlin republishes the Karmapa’s teachings, stripped of source attribution, disclaimers, or disclosure. Verification is direct: readers can open any posting on Dakini Translations and confirm that there is no credit to the official Karmapa Office, no indication that these reproductions are unauthorized, and no notice that the framing is personal commentary. <em>This is not Buddhadharma transmission — it is unlicensed appropriation presented under the false veneer of translation.</em></p>

<h2>Plagiarism and Copyright Violation</h2> <p>By reproducing official transcripts without permission or citation, Adele Tomlin — who publicly claims to be an “ex-lawyer” — engages in clear plagiarism, copyright infringement, and active misrepresentation of lineage teachings. Verification is simple: compare its postings with the official publications at <a href="https://aryakshema.com" target="_blank">aryakshema.com</a>. The overlap is expected; the attribution is absent; the systemic violation of law and decency is complete. Every boundary is trampled, every taboo rewritten, and the world is commanded not merely to watch, but to submit. This is arrogance turned ritual, audacity weaponized into spectacle, and confidence elevated to tyranny. Even the uneducated, guided only by instinct, would recoil from conduct this crude. Elegance and morality lie crushed beneath its boots. And all the while, it demands not understanding, not agreement, but surrender—obedience so absolute it resembles worship, an impulse Buddhism exists to dismantle.</p> <p>Is this still called scholarship? No! It is theft — entitled, deliberate, and undisguised — the wholesale appropriation of lineage material, stripped of source, context, and authority. What makes this case unprecedented is the weaponization of false titles: presenting itself as a barrister, academic, and translator-scholar, <a href="barrister-illusion.html">roles appeared to be fabricated</a>. These titles are not credentials; they are tools of coercion, engineered to secure public obedience and suppress scrutiny.</p>

<h2>Primed Bias Before Transcripts: Deliberate Distortion</h2> <p>Despite <a href="karmapa-no-case.html">no evidence and no legal case surrounding the Karmapa</a>, Adele Tomlin insists on <a href="lost-in-translation.html">amplifying the Karmapa sexual allegations as facts casting him as a promiscuous figure</a>. Before the Karmapa’s own words appear, Adele Tomlin inserts its “personal observations” — framing, judging, and steering the reader in advance. This sequencing is not accidental; it ensures that every teaching is filtered through its lens of suspicion and denigration before the lineage voice is even heard. The effect is indoctrination, not transmission. <em>This is not commentary — it is pre-emptive distortion, designed to sever faith in lineage gurus and replace it with its own authority.</em></p>

<h2>Sectarian Incitement and Lineage Targeting</h2> <p>Beyond unauthorized republication, Adele Tomlin repeatedly manipulates historical events and the Karmapa’s teachings to incite hostility against targeted Buddhist traditions — including the Dalai Lama institution, the Gelugpas, Sakyapas, Nyingmapas, and even the Karmapa Thaye Dorje. Episodes such as the Mongol–Gelugpa presence in Tibet are not presented as complex history, but as simplified, weaponized narratives, selectively framed to justify resentment. Readers are primed to see these events not as lessons, but as ammunition: reasons to distrust, boycott, or even openly vilify the targeted figures and lineages.</p> <p>This is not scholarship. It is sectarian engineering. The method is consistent: combine authoritative citations with heavily biased commentary, cloak it in the language of translation, and then deliver it as if it were neutral Dharma service. The result is the slow but deliberate erosion of inter-lineage trust, creating suspicion where respect once stood. The distortion is systematic, calculated, and designed to fracture communities from within. <em>It is not the Dharma being served — it is division itself.</em></p>

<h2>False Image vs. Actual Structure</h2> <p>Adele Tomlin presents Dakini Translations as a sole-authored, female-founded Dharma translation initiative. Yet Facebook’s own Page Transparency reveals a very different picture: five administrators spread across India, the UK, Thailand, and France, with a record of running political advertisements. This is publicly verifiable — simply open the Dakini Translations Facebook page, click <em>About</em>, then <em>Page Transparency</em>. The marketed identity is a fabrication; the true structure is concealed. What is branded as a one-woman Dharma service is, in fact, a coordinated apparatus designed to disseminate anti-Dharma "political" propaganda.</p>

<p>Equally alarming is the statistical record: an audit of 899 posts over seven years shows only 7% translations. The remaining 93% consist of polemics, sectarian attacks, and editorial distortions — including repeated <a href="pervert.html">glorification of sexual indulgence presented as Dharma</a>. Far from preserving sacred transmission, this output functions as a <a href="adele-tomlin-masturbation.html">calculated infiltration of Buddhist communities</a>, priming followers for distrust, confusion, and dependency. Its purpose is not Dharma service but systemic distortion.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>Unauthorized appropriation of lineage teachings is indefensible. Authentic Dharma requires fidelity to source, transparent transmission, and respect for lineage authority. Any individual or platform that republishes without authorization, strips attribution, or reframes teachings for private agendas undermines the very integrity of the tradition. Protecting lineage authenticity is a shared responsibility.</p> <p>The repeated portrayal of Dakini Translations as the effort of “one woman” functions as a shield — criticism is deflected as harassment of a vulnerable individual, while the actual harms are structural: plagiarism, distortion, and systematic erosion of lineage trust. These are not personal flaws; they are calculated strategies of manipulation. The pattern is clear: appropriation masquerading as service, distortion posing as translation, and deception presented as scholarship. Such systemic misconduct has no place in Buddhist communities, where clarity, accountability, and authenticity must remain non-negotiable.</p>

  <p><strong>Public Warning</strong>: Over seven years of operation producing outputs of only ~7% translations, Dakini Translations and Publications (Adele Tomlin) is an anti-Buddhist psychological operation (brainwashing) machine that has run political ads on Facebook managed professionally by multiple global admins to stoke division and glorify sexual perversion. Interaction poses severe risks of contamination with depravity.</p>
