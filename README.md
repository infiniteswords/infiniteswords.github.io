 
Public Record Preservation Repository

## Purpose

This repository exists solely to **preserve and index public-interest material** that has been removed, or made unavailable on third-party platforms following complaints, or moderation actions.

The goal is to support public independent scrutiny, public awareness through record continuity, not advocacy, harassment, or persuasion.

---

## Scope

Materials preserved here may include:

* Previously published blog posts removed from hosting platforms
* Public webpages that were later deleted

All materials are presented **for documentation and verification purposes only**.

---

## Methodology

* Content is reproduced **verbatim**, without alteration to meaning
* Original publication context (date, platform, URL) is clearly stated
* Where available, third-party archival snapshots (e.g. web archives) are cited

No new allegations are introduced within preserved documents.

## What This Repository Is About

This repository aims to safeguard authentic Vajrayana study and practice by providing documented distortions in public-facing works for public scrutiny. Interpretation is left entirely to the readers.

It is **not**:

* A personally driven harassment or targeting campaign
* An attempt to contact, threaten, or influence any individual
* A substitute for legal, journalistic, or institutional processes
* A platform for commentary, speculation, or personal attacks out of personal reasons

## Removal History

Some materials preserved here were previously removed from other platforms following complaints framed under moderation policies (e.g. harassment or abuse).
Their presence here documents **that removal event** as part of the public record.

---

## Use and Citation

Researchers, journalists, and members of the public may reference this repository as a **source archive**, with appropriate citation to original authorship and publication context.

---

## Contact

This repository does not engage in correspondence regarding the subjects of preserved materials.
Issues may be opened **only** for factual corrections (e.g. dates, broken links, provenance errors).
