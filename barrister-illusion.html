<h1>The Barrister Illusion: How Adele Tomlin Fabricated Authority to Silence Critics</h1>

<p>Exposing how Adele Tomlin’s false claim of being a “qualified barrister” collapses under UK legal training requirements and how the fabricated title is used repeatedly to inflate authority and silence critics.</p>

<blockquote>Titles carry weight. That is why false ones are the most dangerous.</blockquote>
<h2>The Claim That Never Was</h2>
<p>For years, Adele Tomlin — better known under Dakini Translations and Publications — has described herself as a “qualified barrister.” To the casual reader, that suggests she once stood in court, legally trained, formally recognized, and bound by the highest standards of evidence and reasoning. But here’s the problem: no trace of her name exists in the official records of the Inns of Court, the body that calls barristers to the Bar in England and Wales. And without that public record, no one is a barrister. Period. So what does it really take to earn that title? Let’s break it down.</p>

<h2>What It Actually Takes to Become a Barrister</h2>
<p>Becoming a barrister in the UK is not a weekend course or a casual identity you can put on a CV. It’s a minimum five-year pathway with strict, public checkpoints:</p>

<ul>
<li>Law degree (LLB) or conversion course (GDL) — 3 years full-time (or 1-year conversion if prior degree).</li>
<li>Bar Professional Training Course (BPTC) — 1 year full-time, heavily regulated.</li>
<li>Call to the Bar — admission ceremony at one of the four Inns of Court (Lincoln’s Inn, Inner Temple, Middle Temple, Gray’s Inn). This is a publicly recorded event. If your name isn’t there, you are not a barrister.</li>
<li>Pupillage — 1 year of supervised practice under a qualified barrister before working independently.</li>
<li>Without these four steps, no one can legally present themselves as a barrister.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Silence of the Records</h2>
<p>Every barrister’s name is verifiable. That’s the point: transparency, accountability, and professional traceability. Yet Adele Tomlin’s name is absent from all Inns of Court registers.</p>

<p>That means:</p>

<ul><li>She may have studied some law.</li>
<li>She may even have a law degree.</li>
<li>But without being Called to the Bar and completing upillage, she is not a barrister.</li>
<li>This isn’t a small error. It’s an intentional inflation.</li></ul>

<h2>Why Fabricate a Legal Identity?</h2>
<p>Why would someone in the Buddhist translation world claim to be a barrister at all? The answer is power. Authority Shield: A “barrister” is presumed to be logical, evidence-based, trained in justice. By adopting the title, she discourages readers from questioning her distortions.</p>

<ul><li>Intimidation Factor: When accused of spreading falsehoods or smears, she can flash her fake legal identity as if to say: “I know the law. Who are you to argue?”</li>
<li>Narrative Control: In spiritual disputes — such as her smear campaigns against Tibetan teachers — a barrister’s authority tilts the audience toward believing her version of events.</li></ul>
<p>This is not an accident. It is a tactic.</p>

<h2>The Pattern of Inflation</h2>
<p>Once you see this, you begin to notice the larger pattern:</p>

<ul><li>Inflated academic claims. German academia does not use first-class grading system as in UK. Yet, Adele Tomlin claims to earn "first-class honors."</li>
<li>Inflated translations. Frames thesis-based book as landmark work; positions herself as authority on zhentong, though student-level research. Most translations are plagiarized, copyright violations, appropriated unethically as her historical work.</li>
<li>Inflated authority. Unverifieable self-published testimonies on her own website. "Founder and director" of just an ordinary blog with paid domain anyone can establish, not a legal entity of any weight.</li></ul>

<p>All designed to place Adele Tomlin beyond question, so she can <a href="lost-in-translation.html">launch accusations without accountability.</a></p>

<h2>Closing Thoughts: Why This Matters</h2>
<p>Spiritual predators rarely come with warning labels. They arrive cloaked in borrowed credibility: robes, titles, qualifications, and achievements that sound too impressive to doubt. Exposing false credentials is not petty nitpicking. It is public protection. It strips away the armor that allows manipulation to thrive. Adele Tomlin is not a barrister. She never was. And the sooner readers see through the illusion, the sooner her weaponized authority loses its grip.</p>
