<h1>Operative Presumptions of Dakini Translations</h1>
<p>This forensic glossary catalogues the most frequently encoded narrative and psychological assumptions embedded within Adele Tomlin’s platform, <em>Dakini Translations</em>. Each entry reveals a core manipulation pattern masked as spiritual activism or poetic insight.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Presumption of Inherent Superiority</strong><br/>
Adele Tomlin operates from a latent presumption that her understanding of Vajrayāna, translation, ethics, and gender is categorically superior to all others — including lineage holders, seasoned practitioners, and traditional scholars. This belief justifies her tone of condescension, dismissiveness, and unsolicited correction of senior figures. It fuels her need to appear as the lone clarifier of confusion and cultivator of truth, while positioning everyone else as deluded, cowardly, or complicit in spiritual degeneration. Strategic function: Enables self-canonization, invalidates external critique, and elevates her blog into a doctrinal throne room.</li>
<li><strong>Presumption of Self-Entitlement</strong><br/>
Adele Tomlin operates under a presumption that she inherently deserves special status, access, and exemption from accountability within Vajrayāna communities. This self-entitlement justifies boundary violations, dismisses others’ roles or concerns, and fuels a narrative where her demands override traditional protocols and respect. It underpins her manipulative posture of victimhood while maintaining control and privilege.</li>
<li><strong>Presumption of Guilt</strong><br/>
Adele Tomlin cynically presumes guilt in everyone—from gurus and their staff to volunteers at empowerment events—regardless of evidence. This relentless suspicion casts a blanket of distrust, framing all actions and intentions as inherently corrupt or malicious. Such universal guilt presumption fuels division, paranoia, and preemptive condemnation, effectively eroding community trust and obstructing honest dialogue.</li>
<li><strong>Presumption of Compassion Hostage</strong><br/>
Adele Tomlin exploits the Karmapa’s compassion as a weaponized leash, demanding unconditional salvation despite her attacks and provocations. She holds his compassion hostage to justify relentless abuse, evade accountability, and enforce her spiritual martyrdom narrative. This presumption traps the guru in a coercive bind, shattering genuine trust and weaponizing Vajrayāna ethics for personal manipulation.</li>
<li><strong>Presumption of Feminism as Legal Armor</strong><br/>
Feminist language and rhetoric are deployed not as genuine tools of liberation or solidarity, but as a strategic shield to deflect critical scrutiny and invalidate opposing voices. By equating dissent with patriarchal violence or misogyny, this presumption weaponizes feminist discourse to insulate personal agendas from accountability and debate.</li>
<li><strong>Presumption of Erotic Martyrdom</strong><br/>
Erotic symbolism, narratives of rejection, and longing are systematically reframed as spiritual teachings or mystical wisdom. This presumption elevates deeply personal emotional wounds into quasi-prophetic revelations, blurring boundaries between trauma and enlightenment to justify manipulative emotional dependency.</li>
<li><strong>Presumption of Narrative Sacrifice</strong><br/>
Personal suffering and isolation are sacralized as essential credentials for spiritual authority. This presumption casts Adele Tomlin as a lone, persecuted truth-teller whose mission is validated by betrayal and neglect, thereby demanding sympathy and discouraging critical inquiry.</li>
<li><strong>Presumption of Divine Authority via Translation</strong><br/>
Adele Tomlin positions her translations not as scholarly academic work subject to peer review and doctrinal verification, but as unique channels for accessing divine feminine truth exclusively available to her. This presumption bypasses all traditional standards of textual transparency and accountability, framing her interpretive output as spiritually infallible and revelatory. By claiming such divine authority, she immunizes her translations from critique and positions herself as a singular visionary, whose insights are to be accepted as sacred doctrine rather than open to examination.</li>
<li><strong>Presumption of Dangerous Institutions</strong><br/>
Institutional bodies like the CTA, the Gelugpa sect, and monastic establishments are portrayed as inherently oppressive and hostile toward feminine spiritual truth. This presumption cultivates distrust toward established authority, framing opposition as systemic sexism and conspiracy.</li>
<li><strong>Presumption of Bodhisattvic Disobedience</strong><br/>
Acts commonly considered breaches of samaya—such as publicly exposing private grievances, criticizing lineage holders, or breaking vows—are reinterpreted as compassionate and enlightened resistance. This presumption justifies rebellious behavior under the guise of higher Dharma service, while obscuring self-interest.</li>
<li><strong>Presumption of Ethical Reversal</strong><br/>
Core Buddhist ethical principles such as restraint, samaya, and vinaya are inverted, portrayed as tools that enable abuse and suppress truth. Conversely, public emotional displays and confrontational actions are valorized as genuine virtue and spiritual courage, undermining traditional moral frameworks.</li>
<li><strong>Presumption of One-Way Pure Perception</strong><br/>
This presumption demands unwavering purity of perception, grace, and spiritual tolerance directed solely toward Adele Tomlin and her inner circle, while aggressively vilifying any critics or questioners as spiritually deluded, jealous, or malevolent. It enforces a one-sided lens that polices community response and silences dissent.</li>
<li><strong>Presumption of Silenced Heroism</strong><br/>
Adele Tomlin actively frames herself as a courageous truth-teller besieged by corrupt, jealous, or powerful enemies seeking to silence her. This presumption weaponizes opposition as automatic proof of her moral and spiritual superiority. It delegitimizes all criticism by branding dissent as conspiracy, sabotage, or patriarchal suppression, thereby discouraging any critical examination of her claims or behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Presumption of Divine Substitution</strong><br/>
She claims to embody or channel enlightened feminine archetypes such as the Dakini or Tārā, positioning herself as a living embodiment or replacement of these sacred figures. This presumption elevates her narrative beyond human accountability by invoking divine authority.</li>
<li><strong>Presumption of Feminine Redemption Myth</strong><br/>
Adele Tomlin’s voice is singularly framed as the necessary and exclusive force restoring balance, purity, and lost feminine wisdom to Vajrayāna Buddhism. This presumption negates pluralistic perspectives and centers her as the sole redeemer of spiritual authenticity.</li>
<li><strong>Presumption of Ritual Blackmail</strong><br/>
Participation in spiritual rituals is manipulated as leverage—exclusion is publicly exposed as spiritual injustice, while inclusion is claimed as evidence of privileged status. This presumption weaponizes ritual access to coerce compliance and elevate personal standing.</li>
<li><strong>Presumption of Editorial Priesthood</strong><br/>
Adele Tomlin elevates her blog and translation platform to the status of a sacred temple or priesthood, presenting herself as the exclusive gatekeeper and dispenser of spiritual revelation. This presumption creates a hierarchy where her editorial role is beyond reproach or democratic critique, demanding reverence akin to religious clergy. By sanctifying her position as editor and “spiritual priestess,” she precludes critical engagement and frames any questioning as sacrilegious or disrespectful, thus consolidating narrative control.</li>
<li><strong>Presumption of Mythic Parallelism</strong><br/>
Adele Tomlin draws explicit parallels between her life and suffering and the biographies of saints or spiritual heroines. This presumption maps ancient archetypes onto personal experience, seeking to validate her narrative through mythic resonance and spiritual archeology.</li>
<li><strong>Presumption of Monastic Hypocrisy as Norm</strong><br/>
Assumes by default that all monks and traditional teachers are spiritually compromised or hypocritical unless they explicitly endorse Adele’s narrative. This presumption undermines monastic authority and sows distrust in established lineage holders.</li>
<li><strong>Presumption of Public Dharma Override</strong><br/>
Elevates public transparency and outrage above traditional teacher-student confidentiality and samaya obligations, justifying breaches of sacred trust as necessary for spiritual reform.</li>
<li><strong>Presumption of Redemptive Estrangement</strong><br/>
This presumption takes actual rejection or alienation by religious authorities, institutions, or communities as irrefutable evidence that Adele alone holds the exclusive truth. It sanctifies her estrangement, transforming alienation and dissent into symbols of spiritual purity and authenticity. Rather than perceiving exclusion as a consequence of actions or attitudes, it is reinterpreted as a spiritual badge of honor and vindication.</li>

<div class="stamp">
<p><strong>Public Warning</strong>: Mounting evidence of misconduct points to one painful and unavoidable conclusion. Over seven years of operation producing unauthorized dubious translations, Adele Tomlin has been abusing the sacred name of Dakini to infiltrate the Buddhist community and execute anti-Buddhadharma psychological operation to corrupt Vajrayana from within by: advocating twisted views, denigrating (past and present) lineage gurus, disseminating hearsays, seeding conflict, running political ads in coordination with multiple global admins on Facebook. Until statements of accountability are formally issued, association with such a <em>self-endorsed figure (mara) absent authentic lineage authorization</em> guarantees samaya breach, energetic contamination, karmic entanglement, merit dissolution, dualistic imprisonment, klesha accumulation, and spiritual atrophy.</p></div>
