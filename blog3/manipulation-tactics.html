<h1>27 Manipulation Tactics Found in Adele Tomlin’s Writings</h1>
<p>This living glossary catalogs <strong>the rhetorical, psychological, and narrative manipulation techniques</strong> repeatedly found in Adele Tomlin’s blog posts, interviews, and comment trails — including her use of factional framing between Buddhist leaders — with examples, definitions, and the underlying strategic purpose of each. It is designed to help readers see how techniques such as emotional appeal, selective quotation, and implied rivalry can be used to shape perception and amplify division.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Designed as a <strong>decoder key</strong>, this glossary helps readers distinguish:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spiritual expression from emotional manipulation</li>
<li>Genuine scholarship from self-serving mysticism</li>
<li>Feminist empowerment from narcissistic branding</li>
<li>Transparent translation from weaponized poetry</li>
</ul>

<h2>Examples:</h2>
<h3><strong>Dakini Victim Complex</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A pattern where the author equates critique of her ideas or behavior with an attack on all women, or the sacred feminine principle.</p>
<p><strong>Usage:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>“This is how awakened women are treated in Tibetan Buddhism.”</li>
<li>“They fear the truth of the feminine voice.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Protects herself from specific critique by generalizing it.</li>
<li>Transforms disagreement into oppression.</li>
<li>Gains moral sympathy while avoiding direct accountability.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Factional Framing</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A narrative technique that casts relationships between respected Buddhist leaders or lineages in terms of rivalry, conflict, or ideological opposition — often by emphasizing selective quotes, events, or interpretations.</p>
<p><strong>Usage:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>“Why should anyone praise the Dalai Lama and Gelugpa in such nyperbolic absurd way? This has to be satire as people must resent their dominance over Tibet for too long.”</li>
<li>“Thaye Dorje is never anyone, only Ogyen Trinley is the real Karmapa.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Positions the author as an insider revealing hidden disputes.</li>
<li>Encourages readers to see harmony as unlikely or impossible.</li>
<li>Amplifies the perception of instability within the tradition, increasing the author’s perceived importance as interpreter.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Leader Pitting</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The deliberate juxtaposition of statements, teachings, or symbolic gestures from two respected leaders to imply direct opposition — often by omitting context or nuance.</p>
<p><strong>Usage:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>“The Karmapa has mentioned the past Mongol-Gelug issue that the Dalai Lama still refuses to address.”</li>
<li>“Unlike the Dalai Lama, the Karmapa speaks the real truth about vegetarian issue.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Encourages readers to take sides between leaders who may not actually be in conflict.</li>
<li>Elevates the author’s role as mediator, truth-bearer, or faction champion.</li>
<li>Uses the prestige of one figure to diminish the credibility of another.</li>
</ul>

<div class="stamp">
<p><strong>Public Warning</strong>: Mounting evidence of misconduct points to one painful and unavoidable conclusion. Over seven years of operation producing unauthorized dubious translations, Adele Tomlin has been abusing the sacred name of Dakini to infiltrate the Buddhist community and execute anti-Buddhadharma psychological operation to corrupt Vajrayana from within by: advocating twisted views, denigrating (past and present) lineage gurus, disseminating hearsays, seeding conflict, running political ads in coordination with multiple global admins on Facebook. Until statements of accountability are formally issued, association with such a <em>self-endorsed figure (mara) absent authentic lineage authorization</em> guarantees samaya breach, energetic contamination, karmic entanglement, merit dissolution, dualistic imprisonment, klesha accumulation, and spiritual atrophy.</p></div>
