<h1>Who Is the Original Adele Tomlin? The Woman Behind the Mask of Vajrayana Spirituality</h1>
<p>A manipulative self-promoter who exploits sacred teachings and spiritual authority to serve her ego and personal agendas, <strong>Adele Tomlin</strong> is not a genuine Vajrayāna practitioner or translator. Alarming patterns of deception, narrative control, and parasitic emotional exploitation designed to confuse and harm sincere practitioners through her platform, Dakini Translations and Publications, are consistently found in over 92% of her writing, based on our review of all her 899 posts.</p>
<h2>1. False Translator, True Narcissist</h2>
<ul>
<li>Claims academic and spiritual authority but lacks credible peer-reviewed scholarship.</li>
<li>Uses poetic, mystical language to mask factual errors and editorial inventions.</li>
<li>Recycles and distorts traditional Vajrayāna teachings to serve personal mythmaking.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Master of Manipulative Narrative Control</h2>
<ul>
<li>Frames herself as victim and heroine simultaneously, weaponizing feminism and spiritual victimhood.</li>
<li>Silences critics by labeling dissenters as misogynists or spiritual saboteurs.</li>
<li>Creates an echo chamber by citing only her own platform to “prove” legitimacy.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Exploiter of Compassion and Feminine Symbolism</h2>
<ul>
<li>Leverages eroticized spiritual imagery and symbolic martyrdom to bind readers emotionally.</li>
<li>Abuses the Karmapa’s compassion to justify unaccountable behavior and attack the lineage.</li>
<li>Centralizes herself as the “wisdom consort” and exclusive feminine voice, erasing others.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Weaponizer of Victimhood and Trauma</h2>
<ul>
<li>Inflates personal grievances to systemic conspiracies to evade accountability.</li>
<li>Uses trauma narratives as shields against critique, turning vulnerability into a weapon.</li>
<li>Deploys coded language and symbolic concealment to confuse and disarm.</li>
</ul>
<h2>5. Cultivator of Division and Sectarian Distrust</h2>
<ul>
<li>Portrays legitimate Buddhist institutions and lineages as corrupt, hostile, or oppressive.</li>
<li>Encourages followers to distrust traditional teachers and favor her personalized narrative.</li>
<li>Undermines Vajrayāna unity by sowing paranoia and factionalism.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Call to Awareness and Clarity</h2>
<p>Given Adele Tomlin’s toxic presence masquerading as a spiritual authority, recognizing her patterns is essential to protect the Vajrayana community and safeguard the Dharma’s integrity. This is a call to discernment, critical inquiry, and collective accountability — not blind faith or ideological entanglement.</p>

<div class="stamp">
<p><strong>Public Warning</strong>: Mounting evidence of misconduct points to one painful and unavoidable conclusion. Over seven years of operation producing unauthorized dubious translations, Adele Tomlin has been abusing the sacred name of Dakini to infiltrate the Buddhist community and execute anti-Buddhadharma psychological operation to corrupt Vajrayana from within by: advocating twisted views, denigrating (past and present) lineage gurus, disseminating hearsays, seeding conflict, running political ads in coordination with multiple global admins on Facebook. Until statements of accountability are formally issued, association with such a <em>self-endorsed figure (mara) absent authentic lineage authorization</em> guarantees samaya breach, energetic contamination, karmic entanglement, merit dissolution, dualistic imprisonment, klesha accumulation, and spiritual atrophy.</p></div>
