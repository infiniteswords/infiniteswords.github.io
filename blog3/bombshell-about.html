<h1>About</h1>
<p>Little does the public know, beyond the prolific blog posts of Dakini Translations and Publications spanning over seven years since 2018 lies a more complex and even more controversial story. Because no one else has taken the responsibility to archive these public writings and analyze them objectively, we feel compelled to do so, driven by the sheer volume of misrepresentations they contain. The time and effort spent poring over every single post isn’t just exhausting but also heartbreaking. Again and again, we witness sacred Dharma teachings twisted to serve a self-centered agenda, stripped of their integrity, and wielded with disrespect. A painful journey no one should ever have to take: a descent into a trail of writings so soaked in distortion and malice that it wounds the emotional heart, pierces the clarity of mind, and corrodes the physical body with unimaginable psychological trauma. With every post dissected, we relive the heartbreak of watching sacred Dharma mutilated – not once, but again and again, with deliberate precision and not a trace of remorse! Each step reveals another line crossed, another act of spiritual betrayal dressed up as virtue. It doesn’t just uncover the truth – it devastates ANYONE who dares to look. When the sacred is twisted so brazenly, the wound doesn’t stay in the mind; it seeps into the bones. The physical body simply corrodes under the pressure of what the heart cannot hold and the mind cannot reconcile.</p>
<p>We do not speak as distant observers. We speak as those who’ve lived through the heartbreak – watching Dharma disfigured, trust betrayed, and silence manipulated into complicity. We carry the scars of what we’ve read. We’ve fallen sick, lost sleep, and questioned our sanity. But we did not stop. Because to leave this unexamined would be to let it fester. By presenting this dissection – as shaped by her own writings, failed Wikipedia submissions, and strategic use of Buddhist authority figures – we invite you to form your own judgment of who Adele Tomlin is, or perhaps more accurately, what she embodies. Through careful examination of how her public identity has evolved over time, we lay bare the patterns, contradictions, and calculated transformations that speak louder than any claim she makes. This archive is not a conclusion – it is an opening. The judgment belongs to the public. We only provide the record, built with precision and purpose.</p>
<p>Launched in July 2025 as an ethical call for tranparency, this site is a publicly accessible forensic record focused on the symbolic language, rhetorical strategies, and psychological techniques used across hundreds of posts published on <em>d</em>a<em>kinitranslations.com</em> (April 19, 2018 – July 6, 2025). It was created to serve:</p>
<ul>
<li>readers seeking clarity about emotionally complex or contradictory Dharma narratives;</li>
<li>researchers examining the use of symbolic manipulation in spiritual media;</li>
<li>practitioners wishing to distinguish between authentic lineage communication and persuasive narrative framing.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are deeply committed to the <strong>preservation of authentic Vajrayana Buddhist transmission</strong>. Our goal is not to attack any individual but to <strong>document recurring patterns of distortion</strong>, and to empower readers to protect themselves against spiritual abuse with tools of symbolic literacy. We do NOT claim private access, inside knowledge, or lineage authority. All material is based on publicly accessible content, which can and should be verified by readers independently to form their own judgments.</p>
<h3><strong>Public Accountability, Not Harassment</strong></h3>
<p>Adele Tomlin repeatedly promotes <em>Dakini Translations and Publications</em> as a “solo-authored resource” for Vajrayana translation:</p>
<blockquote>
“First female-founded (and solo-authored) resource by published scholar-translator-practitioner, Adele Tomlin, for original, new translations and research, music, interviews and more on Buddhism and Vajrayana.”</blockquote>
<p>Yet Facebook’s own <strong>Page Transparency records</strong> tell a different story. What presents itself as a one-woman project of Buddhist devotion is in fact run by a <strong>multi-country administrative network</strong> with operators located in Thailand (2), India, France, and the UK. Such a structure looks less like the humble work of a translator and far more like a <strong>political propaganda machine</strong> coordinated across borders.</p>
<p>Even more damaging to her claims of authenticity, the very same Transparency records confirm that <strong>political category advertisements</strong> were run through the page. In other words, what is publicly branded as “a spiritual, scholarly translation resource” doubles behind the scenes as an <strong>apparatus of persuasion and influence</strong>, blurring the line between Dharma communication and political campaigning.</p>
<p>This contradiction is not an isolated oversight — it is a pattern. The carefully crafted persona of the “solo female scholar-translator” collapses under the weight of publicly verifiable evidence: <strong>a networked operation, funded reach, political targeting, and a deception of scale</strong>. What Adele Tomlin markets as Dharma turns out, under forensic light, to be indistinguishable from <strong>manufactured influence</strong>.</p>

<figure><img alt="Facebook Page Transparency shows that Dakini Translations and Publications, which allegedly run by Adele Tomlin, the sole author alone on Vajrayana Buddhist translation, has run political ads with five admins across different countries around the globe." src="../images/img_20250729_082627.jpg"/><figcaption>Transparency records expose the double life of Dakini Translations: marketed as “solo-authored,” operated as a global propaganda channel with political ads and international admin machinery.</figcaption></figure>
<p>In conclusion, <em>Dakini Translations</em> <em>and Publications</em> (by Adele Tomlin) has engaged in sustained public communication and international promotion, placing it in the category of <strong>a public figure</strong> in religious and political discourse. By consequence, its<em> public use of spiritual language to influence perception <strong>deserves public examination</strong> with precision, neutrality, and compassion.</em> This is never a matter of personal interest, but of accountability, transparency, and the public’s right to verify claims and activities. This blog operates in full accordance to universal values of transparency and open public discourse. Removing this blog under a non-harassment policy would risk shielding a corrupt public figure from legitimate scrutiny, even unintentionally amplifying their pernicious impact on the society. All sources are public and readers are encouraged to verify independently and form their own conclusions.</p><span></span>

<div class="stamp">
<p><strong>Public Warning</strong>: Mounting evidence of misconduct points to one painful and unavoidable conclusion. Over seven years of operation producing unauthorized dubious translations, Adele Tomlin has been abusing the sacred name of Dakini to infiltrate the Buddhist community and execute anti-Buddhadharma psychological operation to corrupt Vajrayana from within by: advocating twisted views, denigrating (past and present) lineage gurus, disseminating hearsays, seeding conflict, running political ads in coordination with multiple global admins on Facebook. Until statements of accountability are formally issued, association with such a <em>self-endorsed figure (mara) absent authentic lineage authorization</em> guarantees samaya breach, energetic contamination, karmic entanglement, merit dissolution, dualistic imprisonment, klesha accumulation, and spiritual atrophy.</p></div>
