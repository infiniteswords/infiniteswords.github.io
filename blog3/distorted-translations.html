<h1>From Dakini Translations to Distorted Translations: When Commentary Hijacks Dharma</h1>
<p>Even in her so-called translations, Adele Tomlin does not refrain from narrative manipulation. The <a href="audit-mastertable.html/">899-Post Forensic Audit of Dakini Translations</a> revealed this as a systematic tactic, not an occasional slip. Across the dataset, analysts documented:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="manipulation-tactics.html">27 Manipulation Tactics</a></li>
<li><a href="operative-presumptions.html">21 Operative Presumptions</a></li>
<li><a href="psychological-archetypes.html">8 Psychological Archetypes</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Within this framework, translation abuse was repeatedly flagged.</p>
<h2>Commentary First, Dharma Later</h2>
<p>Her articles almost always begin with a lengthy preamble of personal opinion, symbolic positioning, or grievance, priming the reader’s psychology before Dharma is presented. In the case of the 17th Karmapa, the official transcript, when present, is invariably pushed to the bottom, effectively subordinated to Adele’s own voice.</p>
<h2>Subtle Theft Disguised as Devotion</h2>
<p>Almost all “translations” were found to paraphrase or modify publicly available teachings without clear citation of the official source. As people question why Adele Tomlin would do redundant translations to compete with the official websites of the Karmapa, the audit flags Adele’s <a href="../blog1/master-narcissism.html">Birthday Tribute to the Karmapa as a case study that unearth a pattern of deeply disturbing core mentality: ‘I give you the guru so give me your mind.’</a> This mentality aligns well with her <a href="seduced-absence.html">persistent stalking of the Karmapa as obsessively narrated in her own report</a>. Another example is her own <a href="contact-page-recoded.html">Contact Page, which abundantly shows how she pre-empts any criticism by establishing moral superiority over readers</a>.</p>
<h2>Why This Is Dangerous</h2>
<p>This tactic exploits the lama’s authority while filtering their words through Adele’s emotional, erotic, or sectarian lens. The reader arrives at authentic Dharma only after being shaped by her narrative. It is a form of perceptual hijacking: commentary dressed as translation, masquerading as lineage.</p>
<h2>Our Recommendation</h2>
<ol>
<li>Transparency: Adele Tomlin should clearly mark when content is her own interpretation versus a direct citation.</li>
<li>Verification: When referencing teachings of the Karmapa or other lamas, official transcripts should be directly linked.</li>
<li>Reader Safeguard: Practitioners should cross-check her posts against canonical or verified sources before accepting her framings.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Dharma is not a mirror for personal projection. To manipulate it as such is neither translation nor scholarship. The 899-audit leaves no doubt: what Adele Tomlin presents as Dakini Translations and Publications is systematically distorted through manipulation tactics, false presumptions, and archetypal projections; an unmistakeable pattern of spiritual deception, if not <a href="../index.html">intentional propaganda to wage sectarian wars</a>.</p>

<div class="stamp">
<p><strong>Public Warning</strong>: Mounting evidence of misconduct points to one painful and unavoidable conclusion. Over seven years of operation producing unauthorized dubious translations, Adele Tomlin has been abusing the sacred name of Dakini to infiltrate the Buddhist community and execute anti-Buddhadharma psychological operation to corrupt Vajrayana from within by: advocating twisted views, denigrating (past and present) lineage gurus, disseminating hearsays, seeding conflict, running political ads in coordination with multiple global admins on Facebook. Until statements of accountability are formally issued, association with such a <em>self-endorsed figure (mara) absent authentic lineage authorization</em> guarantees samaya breach, energetic contamination, karmic entanglement, merit dissolution, dualistic imprisonment, klesha accumulation, and spiritual atrophy.</p></div>
