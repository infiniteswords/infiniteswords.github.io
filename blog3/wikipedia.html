<h1>Wikipedia and the Attempted Construction of Authority</h1>
<p><strong>A Public Record of Repeated Rejections and Self-Citation Strategies</strong></p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Between late 2024 and early 2025, multiple attempts were made to create a Wikipedia biography for Adele Tomlin. Each was rejected — not due to bias or censorship, but for failure to meet <strong>Wikipedia’s notability standards</strong>, primarily because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over 90% of references cited <strong>self-published</strong> or <strong>non-independent sources</strong></li>
<li>No <strong>significant third-party coverage</strong> was available to support inclusion</li>
<li>Multiple resubmissions were <strong>unchanged</strong> despite editor feedback</li>
</ul>
<p>This page presents a documented analysis of the submission pattern, the rhetorical structure of the draft, and its symbolic implications for digital authority-building.</p>
<h2>Timeline of Rejection Events</h2>
<figure><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Date</strong></th><th><strong>Outcome</strong></th><th><strong>Reason Given</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Nov 2024</td><td>Declined</td><td>“No independent sourcing; resubmitted unchanged.”</td></tr><tr><td>Dec 2024</td><td>Rejected</td><td>“Fails notability; lacks third-party sources.”</td></tr><tr><td>Jan 2025</td><td>Rejected again</td><td>“Relies almost entirely on self-published content.”</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>Each resubmission was made using the same or near-identical content, with little to no incorporation of editorial suggestions.</p>
<h2>The Draft’s Claims</h2>
<p>The rejected draft presented Adele Tomlin as:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Buddhist translator and founder of <em>Dakini Translations</em></li>
<li>A pioneering female figure in Buddhist publishing</li>
<li>A contributor to Buddhistdoor, Tricycle, IIAS, and other Buddhist platforms</li>
<li>A scholar of tantric and feminine aspects of Tibetan Buddhism</li>
</ul>
<p>However, almost every reference linked back to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Her <strong>own blog</strong></li>
<li>Articles where she was the <strong>author, not the subject</strong></li>
<li>Mentions in media outlets without <strong>independent analysis</strong> of her role</li>
</ul>
<p>This pattern triggered Wikipedia’s standard content policies around <strong>notability</strong>, <strong>verifiability</strong>, and <strong>independent coverage</strong>.</p>
<h2>Why This Case Study Matters</h2>
<p>This is not a personal critique. It is a <strong>symbolic analysis</strong> of how digital personas attempt to manufacture legitimacy.</p>
<h3>Recurrent patterns include:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Self-authorship as validation</strong>: Treating repetition of one’s own content as evidence of notability</li>
<li><strong>Platform obsession</strong>: Treating Wikipedia as an “online credential” to mask lack of institutional recognition</li>
<li><strong>Control of public narrative</strong>: Through blog traffic diversion, post structuring, and third-party suppression attempts</li>
</ul>
<p>These tactics mirror patterns documented in the rest of this site.</p>

<h2>Ethical Commentary</h2>
<p>This page is presented as <strong>a case study in symbolic narrative construction</strong> and digital self-curation. The attempt to force one’s own biography into a communal encyclopedia highlights a deeper dependency on symbolic platforms for spiritual or academic recognition.</p>

<div class="stamp">
<p><strong>Public Warning</strong>: Mounting evidence of misconduct points to one painful and unavoidable conclusion. Over seven years of operation producing unauthorized dubious translations, Adele Tomlin has been abusing the sacred name of Dakini to infiltrate the Buddhist community and execute anti-Buddhadharma psychological operation to corrupt Vajrayana from within by: advocating twisted views, denigrating (past and present) lineage gurus, disseminating hearsays, seeding conflict, running political ads in coordination with multiple global admins on Facebook. Until statements of accountability are formally issued, association with such a <em>self-endorsed figure (mara) absent authentic lineage authorization</em> guarantees samaya breach, energetic contamination, karmic entanglement, merit dissolution, dualistic imprisonment, klesha accumulation, and spiritual atrophy.</p></div>
