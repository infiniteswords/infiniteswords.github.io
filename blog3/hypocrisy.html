<h1>Hypocrisy of Adele Tomlin: A Strategic Manipulation of Feminism and Bodhicitta</h1>
<p>Careful forensic analysis irrefutably demonstrates that Adele Tomlin’s self-styled feminist identity within Vajrayāna Buddhism is a calculated façade designed to shield her ego and protect personal interests. Her weaponization of feminist and Buddhist discourse flagrantly contradicts the fundamental principles she claims to uphold.</p>
<h3>1. Feminism as a Shield from Accountability</h3>
<p>Adele Tomlin relentlessly positions herself as a “woman speaking truth to male power,” a “female translator breaking barriers,” and a “feminine spiritual voice silenced by jealous men.” This narrative is a deliberate defense mechanism to evade legitimate criticism by falsely framing opposition as patriarchal misogyny. Consequently, any challenge to her work is immediately rebranded as an attack on feminist principles, weaponizing social justice to immunize herself from scrutiny.</p>
<blockquote><p>It is not feminism. It is narcissism masquerading as feminism.</p></blockquote>
<h3>2. Centralization of the Feminine — But Only Her Own</h3>
<p>While Tomlin created <em>Dakini Translations</em> under the guise of promoting female spiritual voices, her actions reveal a self-serving monopoly on “feminine empowerment.” She systematically excludes other female translators, silences dissenting women, and deletes critiques that threaten her narrative. Her so-called “feminine principle” is tightly bound to her own image, erasing pluralism and replacing it with a singular, authoritarian voice.</p>
<h3>3. Eroticization and Feminist Rhetoric as Tools for Control</h3>
<p>Tomlin frequently <a href="../blog1/feminism-weaponized.html">intertwines feminine sensuality, mystical longing, erotic tantric metaphors, and feminist discourse</a>. However, these elements serve not to liberate women or empower female sexuality, but to construct emotional dependence and cultivate personal martyrdom. She performs intimate rituals with male teachers, <a href="../blog1/persistent-sexualization.html">spiritualizes rejection as empowerment, and eroticizes silence and longing, presenting these as spiritual awakening. This is emotional manipulation disguised as sexual liberation</a>, creating a codependency that controls her audience and spiritual narrative.</p>
<h3>4. Weaponizing Criticism to Protect Her Brand</h3>
<p>Tomlin inflates personal grievances into systemic victimhood, generalizing that “men fear awakened women,” claiming erasure from history, and equating any dissent with abuse. This trauma hijacking invalidates legitimate critique and reinforces her self-perceived martyrdom. It is a deliberate strategy to avoid accountability and entrench her irreplaceable status in the spiritual community.</p>
<h3>5. Anti-Bodhicitta and the Exclusion of Threats to Her Ideology</h3>
<p>At the core of Tomlin’s hypocrisy is a warped stance on Bodhicitta and a deep disdain for women who threaten her control. Laywomen embodying sexual energy or challenging her authority are branded threats to Dharma and excluded from key Vajrayāna events, especially those related to the Karmapa. This distorted interpretation of Bodhicitta prioritizes self-preservation and exclusion over compassion and collective awakening.</p>
<h3>6. Adeleism: The Subversion of the Karmapa’s Authority</h3>
<p>Tomlin promotes “Adeleism,” a self-serving ideology that undermines the Karmapa’s teachings. By sowing doubts about the Karmapa’s actions and discrediting other Vajrayāna lineages, she seeks to replace his influence with her own. Her manipulative narrative fractures the Vajrayāna community, threatening both the teachings’ integrity and community unity.</p>

<h3>Final Legal Assessment</h3>
<p>Adele Tomlin’s use of feminism is narrative insulation. It protects her mythos, deflects scrutiny, and elevates herself at the expense of all others. This is spiritual narcissism masquerading as gender justice. It does not protect women. It protects one woman’s brand — at the cost of collective clarity, humility, and truth.</p>

<div class="stamp">
<p><strong>Public Warning</strong>: Mounting evidence of misconduct points to one painful and unavoidable conclusion. Over seven years of operation producing unauthorized dubious translations, Adele Tomlin has been abusing the sacred name of Dakini to infiltrate the Buddhist community and execute anti-Buddhadharma psychological operation to corrupt Vajrayana from within by: advocating twisted views, denigrating (past and present) lineage gurus, disseminating hearsays, seeding conflict, running political ads in coordination with multiple global admins on Facebook. Until statements of accountability are formally issued, association with such a <em>self-endorsed figure (mara) absent authentic lineage authorization</em> guarantees samaya breach, energetic contamination, karmic entanglement, merit dissolution, dualistic imprisonment, klesha accumulation, and spiritual atrophy.</p></div>
