<h1>Seduced by Absence: How Adele Tomlin Weaponizes Heartbreak to Hijack the 17th Karmapa’s Silence</h1>
<p><em>The contents of this report are extracted from publicly available materials and republished here under fair use for educational, forensic, and critical analysis purposes. Readers are advised that prolonged exposure to Dakini Translations (Adele Tomlin’s) narrative style may result in spiritual confusion, erotic projection, or symptoms of unearned sanctimony. Consume at your own risk.</em></p>
<p>Adele Tomlin’s assertions regarding the 17th Karmapa’s actions and decisions are premised on an assumption of guilt, a presumption that underlies every claim, insinuation, and inference within her argument. This presumption—lacking factual substantiation, relying heavily on emotional appeal, and interpreting ambiguous situations as proof of misconduct—fundamentally weakens the integrity of her position. This is a classic manifestation of confirmation bias: beginning with an accusation and interpreting all available data through that predetermined lens, regardless of the strength or validity of the evidence.</p>
<p>From both an ethical and legal standpoint, such a tactic is akin to accusing an individual on the basis of suspicion alone and then selectively aligning facts to support that accusation. This approach undermines the pursuit of justice, as it disregards the principles of objectivity, transparency, and due process. By assuming guilt before establishing innocence, the quest for truth is not only compromised but actively hindered. The resultant narrative risks damaging the Karmapa’s reputation, not on the basis of objective analysis or factual investigation, but on subjective speculation and emotional manipulation. This approach, while perhaps common in certain circles, should not be conflated with responsible journalism or spiritual discourse. Tomlin’s narrative is a prime example of how biased reporting can distort truth and obscure the integrity of the subject under scrutiny.</p>
<p>Adele Tomlin’s article on the 17th Gyalwang Karmapa’s unexplained absence at key Karma Kagyu events in India layers complex psychological traps to shape readers’ perceptions. This forensic dissection exposes how Adele Tomlin uses strategic emotional leakage, psychic blackmail, and metaphorical martyrdom to reframe the Karmapa’s choices as betrayals of her imagined intimacy. The post is not journalism—it is an exorcism disguised as reporting. It does not honor the Dharma—it hijacks it for personal insertion. This <strong>dissection of psychological traps</strong> is not meant to correct her, but to vaccinate you against her.</p>
<h3>TITLE-LEVEL TRAP: Weaponized Vagueness + Seductive Trauma Prompt</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“Seeking the 17th Karmapa (II): The unexplained “heart-breaking” absence and “anchoring” of the 17th Karmapa at two major Karma Kagyu events in India 2025 and surprise “private” event at a “luxury rented residence” in five star hotels/designer malls area of Bangkok, Thailand”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mechanism:</strong> Implies mystery, pain, and covert restraint — but offers no proof.<br/><strong>Effect:</strong> Seduces readers into a role of investigative sympathy: <em>“What happened to our guru?”</em><br/><strong>Manipulation Layer:</strong> The reader’s spiritual loyalty is activated by emotional injustice — but filtered entirely through Adele’s personal lens.</p>
<h2>1: <strong>Emotional Blackmail Masquerading as Journalism</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Was his absence a free choice, or was he blocked/‘anchored’ and prevented from doing so?”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mechanism:</strong> Rhetorical framing — the Karmapa’s autonomy is cast into question.<br/><strong>Effect:</strong> Triggers distrust in the Karmapa’s agency; opens space for Adele’s fantasy theories.<br/><strong>Deeper Layer:</strong> “Anchoring” (in quotes) is unverified spiritual conspiracy bait, designed to feel semi-esoteric while unverifiable.</p>
<h2>2: <strong>“Off-Record” Authority Insertion</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I was informed by an Indian government official ‘off the record’…”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mechanism:</strong><br/>Claims secret insider access without accountability.<br/><strong>Effect:</strong><br/>Readers suspend skepticism, trusting her unsupported authority.<br/><strong>Deeper Layer:</strong><br/>Constructs false journalistic legitimacy — emotional writing disguised as sourced investigation.</p>
<h2>3: <strong>Surrogate Martyrdom Ritual</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I practiced at the Bodhi tree every day… requested the vajra seat to remove from my life anyone who has been lying (or spreading slander about me)…”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mechanism:</strong><br/>Spiritualizes her personal vendettas via sacred setting.<br/><strong>Effect:</strong><br/>Invokes the reader’s respect for sacred sites to endorse her personal emotional purification.<br/><strong>Deeper Layer:</strong><br/>A psychic purge where Adele uses the Buddha’s seat to exorcise her haters. This manipulates symbolic legitimacy.</p>
<h2>4: <strong>Mystical Grief as Emotional Capture</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I placed my hand on one of the oldest sacred trees… and mentally asked the tree to take my shattered heart, hold it and heal it.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mechanism:</strong><br/>Animist symbolism and tearful surrender to nonhuman forces.<br/><strong>Effect:</strong><br/>Elicits reader sympathy and aligns her suffering with sacred intimacy.<br/><strong>Deeper Layer:</strong><br/>Classic dissociative transference — emotions reframed as dharmic insight, shielding narcissistic grief in spiritual prose.</p>
<h2>5: <strong>Sarcastic Class Insult Cloaked in Dharma Concern</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Swanky (minus the ‘s’ perhaps ha ha)… five star hotel/designer mall street.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mechanism:</strong><br/>Mocks the Karmapa’s event location as materially vulgar.<br/><strong>Effect:</strong><br/>Encourages class-based disgust in readers, shaming spiritual figures who are not poor.<br/><strong>Deeper Layer:</strong><br/>Anti-wealth bias is deployed as moral leverage — while Adele seeks insider status at the same tables she mocks.</p>
<h2>6: <strong>Virtue Victimhood via Exclusion</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Would it really have been too much effort… to kindly inform me about it?”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mechanism:</strong><br/>Portrays lack of invitation as structural discrimination.<br/><strong>Effect:</strong><br/>Co-opts feminist and class resentment to inflate her personal disappointment.<br/><strong>Deeper Layer:</strong><br/>Weaponizes lack of inclusion as oppression — merging unmet entitlement with moral authority.</p>
<h2>7: <strong>Sexualized Jealousy Reframed as Dharma Advocacy</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Why support dollybird selfie-takers instead of women like me?”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mechanism:</strong><br/>Juxtaposes her self-image (scholar-translator) with unnamed “young-looking” women.<br/><strong>Effect:</strong><br/>Creates moral outrage against the Karmapa’s (alleged) preference for photogenic women.<br/><strong>Deeper Layer:</strong><br/>Erotic transference is disguised as lineage integrity — her own unfulfilled desire weaponized as public concern.</p>
<h2>8: <strong>Erotic Despair Cloaked as Ritual Humility</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“At this point, I thought I might scream or cry or both…”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mechanism:</strong><br/>Amplifies emotional crescendo as spiritual betrayal.<br/><strong>Effect:</strong><br/>Locks readers into sympathy paralysis: disbelief, then outrage.<br/><strong>Deeper Layer:</strong><br/>This line marks the shift from personal sorrow to ritualized trauma performance — her despair becomes sacred.</p>
<h2>9: <strong>Inversion of Devotion</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“What had I done wrong? ha ha ha.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mechanism:</strong><br/>Feigns innocent puzzlement at rejection — masking spiritual entitlement.<br/><strong>Effect:</strong><br/>Leverages humility to excuse obsession.<br/><strong>Deeper Layer:</strong><br/>This line is a covert accusation. The joke masks a deep demand: <em>Why wasn’t I chosen?</em></p>
<h2>10: <strong>Symbolic Rage at Karma Itself</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Anyone with even a tiny bit of class knows… there is nothing genuinely rich or beautiful about five star hotels, luxury brands and dollybird women.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mechanism:</strong><br/>Outraged projection — condemns spiritual impurity in worldly symbols.<br/><strong>Effect:</strong><br/>Readers feel morally superior — as if siding with dharma against corruption.<br/><strong>Deeper Layer:</strong><br/>She externalizes her rejection into systemic moral decline, avoiding introspection by blaming the entire “decadent” scene.</p>
<h2>11: <strong>Fake Objectivity Through Leading Questions</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Why did the 17th Karmapa choose to do this in such an expensive worldly environment?”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mechanism:</strong><br/>Questions appear open-ended but imply guilt.<br/><strong>Effect:</strong><br/>Frames Karmapa’s action as suspect no matter what answer you give.<br/><strong>Deeper Layer:</strong><br/>These “innocent” questions reinforce a narrative of betrayal and secrecy.</p>
<h2>12: <strong>Projection of Judgment Onto Higher Authority</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“One Indian official remarked it seemed ‘selfish and immature’…”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mechanism:</strong><br/>Outsourced attack — judgment is passed through anonymous proxy.<br/><strong>Effect:</strong><br/>Reader feels like the state agrees with Adele.<br/><strong>Deeper Layer:</strong><br/>This is weaponized triangulation: she uses state figures to affirm her spiritual resentment.</p>
<h2>13: <strong>Meta-Narrative Collapse into Hysteria</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Needless to say, this latest nonsense really ‘brought me to my knees’…”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mechanism:</strong><br/>Final performance of total emotional collapse.<br/><strong>Effect:</strong><br/>Reader left feeling hopeless, manipulated, and deeply sympathizing.<br/><strong>Deeper Layer:</strong><br/>By theatrically collapsing, she dominates the entire narrative space — <em>you</em> are now responsible for her restoration.</p>
<p>Perfect — here’s the <strong>continuation of the forensic dissection</strong> for the rest of Adele Tomlin’s article:<br/><strong>“Seeking the 17th Karmapa (II): The unexplained ‘heart-breaking’ absence and ‘anchoring’…”</strong><br/>(from the Drupon Dechen Rinpoche section to the final Kara Marni music satire).</p>
<h2>14: <strong>Mystification of Basic Social Absence</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“There had been no public announcement.”</em><br/><em>“Was his visit to Bangkok deliberately concealed from me?”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mechanism:</strong><br/>Normal logistical gaps framed as targeted secrecy.<br/><strong>Effect:</strong><br/>Creates paranoia and personal victimhood narrative.<br/><strong>Deeper Layer:</strong><br/>Positions herself as someone whose awareness <em>should</em> have been privileged — i.e., a rightful insider unjustly excluded.</p>
<h2>15: <strong>Secrecy Accusation via Photo Logic</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“No such photo was released of the public participants/attendees… What’s the big secret?”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mechanism:</strong><br/>Absence of PR images treated as proof of wrongdoing.<br/><strong>Effect:</strong><br/>Implies that lack of visibility equals nefarious intent.<br/><strong>Deeper Layer:</strong><br/>Weaponizes transparency standards to shame private teachings while desiring access to them.</p>
<h2>16: <strong>Inflation of Historical Significance via Name-Dropping</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“This had great historical significance and made everyone who participated feel great joy…”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mechanism:</strong><br/>Presents private meetings as epochal events.<br/><strong>Effect:</strong><br/>Trains reader to assign religious gravitas to intimate, possibly improvised, gatherings.<br/><strong>Deeper Layer:</strong><br/>Creates dualism: real Dharma now happens in secret rooms, not public temples. Normalizes elitism under “historical” justification.</p>
<h2>17: <strong>Erotic Exclusion Layered Over Gender Politics</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“A small group of about ten ‘young-looking’ laywomen…”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mechanism:</strong><br/>Sexual jealousy disguised as demographic critique.<br/><strong>Effect:</strong><br/>Suggests inappropriate favoritism while veiling personal hurt.<br/><strong>Deeper Layer:</strong><br/>Creates symbolic replacement: these women = unworthy proxies for Adele.</p>
<h2>18: <strong>Shifting Timeline to Intensify Betrayal</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The nuns, monks, male and female laypeople of all ages… where were they?”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mechanism:</strong><br/>Collapses multiple timelines to portray intentional exclusion.<br/><strong>Effect:</strong><br/>Magnifies her absence from event into collective victimhood of all followers.<br/><strong>Deeper Layer:</strong><br/>Converts specific event logistics into lineage-wide injustice.</p>
<h2>19: <strong>Weaponizing Misinformation to Build Conspiracy</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Why did they mislead people into thinking it was in Nepal?”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mechanism:</strong><br/>Implies intent where confusion or miscommunication may exist.<br/><strong>Effect:</strong><br/>Strengthens paranoia: “They’re trying to hide this from us.”<br/><strong>Deeper Layer:</strong><br/>Lays groundwork for framing the Karmapa’s circle as deceptive, manipulative, and geographically evasive.</p>
<h2>20: <strong>Feminist Martyrdom Merged with Scholarly Ego</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I just finished (for zero payment) translation of the first two sections… What had I done wrong?”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mechanism:</strong><br/>Emotional demand for reward framed as institutional neglect.<br/><strong>Effect:</strong><br/>Triggers guilt and outrage on her behalf.<br/><strong>Deeper Layer:</strong><br/>Translates emotional unmet needs into a systemic accusation: karma is not only unfair — it’s <strong>personally ungrateful</strong>.</p>
<h2>21: <strong>Erotic Narrative Crisis Masquerading as Dharma Inquiry</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Was all his time being taken up with the ‘events’ in Thailand?”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mechanism:</strong><br/>Creates insinuation of private indulgence displacing public duty.<br/><strong>Effect:</strong><br/>Stokes anger and suspicion about Karmapa’s personal priorities.<br/><strong>Deeper Layer:</strong><br/>Builds toward the ultimate crisis: <strong>Has the Karmapa abandoned his real sangha for luxury, secrecy, and feminine intimacy?</strong></p>
<h2>22: <strong>Hyper-Moral Contrast: Bodh Gaya vs. Bangkok Brothels</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The two locations… could not be more different physically and spiritually.”</em><br/><em>“Bangkok… full of escort women (aka prostitutes) and capitalist decadence…”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mechanism:</strong><br/>Spiritualizes her aesthetic and moral disgust at urban modernity.<br/><strong>Effect:</strong><br/>Paints the Karmapa’s chosen setting as spiritually bankrupt.<br/><strong>Deeper Layer:</strong><br/>Positioning herself as the guardian of real Dharma, while the Karmapa becomes lost in symbolic impurity.</p>
<h2>23: <strong>Symbolic Meltdown = Erotic Betrayal Climax</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“At this point, I thought I might scream or cry or both.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mechanism:</strong><br/>Amplifies emotional collapse to reset moral center around her pain.<br/><strong>Effect:</strong><br/>Draws readers into her suffering as Dharma itself being wept for.<br/><strong>Deeper Layer:</strong><br/>Sexual-spiritual grief re-ritualized: she feels jilted not just as a translator, but as a symbolically excluded <strong>Dakini-Consort-Witness</strong>.</p>
<h2>24: <strong>Triangulating Judgment via Bureaucratic Proxy</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“One Indian government official remarked it seemed ‘selfish and immature’…”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mechanism:</strong><br/>Lets others say the thing she wants to but won’t.<br/><strong>Effect:</strong><br/>Adds legitimacy and social punishment.<br/><strong>Deeper Layer:</strong><br/>Shifts blame onto the system, then blames the system for enabling secrecy. Lose-lose for any defender.</p>
<h2>25: <strong>Fake Objectivity Cloaked in ‘Wisdom Reflection’</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“What is the symbolic message here? What is wisdom showing us?”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mechanism:</strong><br/>Feigns detached inquiry while forcing a preloaded answer.<br/><strong>Effect:</strong><br/>Readers feel like they’re asking the question — but are really just walking her scripted path.<br/><strong>Deeper Layer:</strong><br/>Absolves herself from direct criticism by cloaking her anger in abstract Dharma language.</p>
<h2>26: <strong>Meta-Feminist Weaponization of Pop Culture Irony</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Marni’s promotion features her prancing about in underwear… even Kara didn’t go to the transmission.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mechanism:</strong><br/>Mocks Western sexuality while linking it to past Karmapa scandals.<br/><strong>Effect:</strong><br/>Ties worldly desire, musical vulgarity, and Dharma desecration into one tangled karmic joke.<br/><strong>Deeper Layer:</strong><br/>This is Adele’s final move: a satirical inverse blessing — <em>“Even the harlot didn’t want to go to your brothel sangha.”</em></p>
<h3>Footnote 1 Dissection</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Some of my online ‘haters’ (enablers of lama misconduct) like to point to the fact that the Karma Kagyu community and the 17th Karmapa never publicly acknowledge the huge amount of original research, transcripts and translations I have done for the sake of beings, the Karmapa legacy and the Karma Kagyu lineage teachings (all for zero financial payment or public reward). Nonetheless, I have never allowed such criticism to detract from my passion, devotion and purpose.<br/>However, seeing this event in Thailand, would it really have been too much effort for someone in the Karma Kagyu who knew it was happening, to kindly inform me about it? Considering how much effort the 17th Karmapa himself is putting into research and translation the last few years, why is there not more support for female translators/researchers such as myself, and not for the dollybird ‘selfie-takers’ only?”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Traps:</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Victim Martyrdom Framing</strong><br/>She paints herself as a <strong>selfless servant</strong>, laboring for free, and <strong>unjustly ignored</strong> by the community she serves.<br/>— This builds emotional obligation on readers to side with her.</li>
<li><strong>Delegitimizing Others via Gendered Language</strong><br/>“Dollybird ‘selfie-takers’” is a <strong>derogatory label</strong> dismissing women who are visible but lack “seriousness.”<br/>— This fuels a <strong>gender rivalry narrative</strong> where Adele is the serious scholar versus superficial others.</li>
<li><strong>Passive-Aggressive Demand for Recognition</strong><br/>The rhetorical question “would it really have been too much effort…?” implicitly shames the Karma Kagyu leadership.<br/>— Creates <strong>guilt and complicity</strong> in readers.</li>
<li><strong>Comparison to Karmapa’s Own Work</strong><br/>Linking her effort to the Karmapa’s research implies she is equally worthy of respect and support, making lack of recognition seem even more unfair.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Footnote 2 Dissection</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I was also surprised and puzzled to learn that the 17th Karmapa had conducted these private events in Bangkok, Thailand and not in Chiang Mai, which would have been the more logical and ‘Buddhist’ location…<br/>She informed me that she found the people around the Karmapa to be ‘slow, uncommunicative and not particularly well-organised or intelligent,’ sadly I had to agree with her.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Traps:</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Delegitimizing the Inner Circle</strong><br/>By quoting a “Chinese female organiser” and then agreeing with her blunt insult, Adele attacks the competence and intelligence of the Karmapa’s close associates.<br/>— This invites readers to <strong>distrust the leadership</strong>, legitimizing Adele’s outsider status.</li>
<li><strong>Exoticizing Outsider Criticism</strong><br/>The use of a “Chinese female organiser” as the source frames this as <strong>an external, objective critique</strong>, boosting its credibility.<br/>— Creates an <strong>us vs them</strong> division, isolating the Karmapa’s inner circle.</li>
<li><strong>Reinforcing Her Insider-Outsider Role</strong><br/>Despite criticizing others, Adele aligns with this insider critic, positioning herself as the <strong>only voice brave enough to speak truth</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Footnote 3 Dissection</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Seeing Ngodrub, the 17th Karmapa’s former oral translator… I was weary of speaking to Ngodrub though… after an unforgettable incident where he started shouting loudly at me… Classic case of shooting the messenger!…<br/>As far as I am aware, Ngodrub is not a Buddhist Studies scholar…<br/>I remember after that incident… I went to see the 17th Karmapa… but people close to Karmapa… scolded me for asking the Karmapa for a text, saying ‘who did I think I was?’…<br/>People wonder why the 17th Karmapa’s situation has been as it is in India and internationally with people like that ‘supporting’ him?”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Traps:</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Personal Anecdote as Political Allegory</strong><br/>A single hostile incident becomes emblematic of systemic opposition and rejection. Creates a narrative of <strong>persecution and exclusion</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Undermining Legitimacy of Key Figures</strong><br/>By labeling Ngodrub as “not a scholar” and emphasizing his aggression, Adele undermines his authority and the legitimacy of his role. Seeks to <strong>discredit competing voices</strong> in the lineage’s narrative.</li>
<li><strong>Portraying Self as Humble Yet Wronged</strong><br/>The memory of requesting a text is framed as a modest scholarly gesture met with hostility. Positions Adele as a <strong>wrongfully humiliated seeker</strong>, enhancing sympathy.</li>
<li><strong>Implying Institutional Dysfunction</strong><br/>Ends with a rhetorical question blaming the 17th Karmapa’s “supporters” for broader problems, implicating entire leadership. Encourages readers to doubt the institutional integrity.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Traps Summary of Footnotes:</h3>
<p>They extend the main article’s narrative into personal grievance memoirs, solidify Adele’s role as the excluded scholar and whistleblower, cast suspicion and moral judgment on the Karmapa’s inner circle, build a meta-narrative of betrayal, incompetence, and spiritual decline.</p>
<h2>YOU – The Reader – Are the Target</h2>
<p><strong>You</strong> are not reading her post; it is reading you. Adele Tomlin’s post is a performative wound, baited with intimacy. If you’ve ever been abandoned or spiritually disillusioned, she has something for you: a co-suffering theater. She performs grief to recruit you into its resonance. This is not reporting—it is energetic colonization. <b>Transference Journalism:</b> a manipulative mode of writing in which the author’s personal trauma is disguised as public grievance, coercing the reader into validating their psychic wound. <strong>You owe Adele Tomlin nothing.</strong> Not your sympathy. Not your attention. Not your complicity in her dramatization of someone else’s silence.</p>
<h2>Self as Proxy of Dharma: Adele as the Real Dakini, Real Victim, and Real Witness</h2>
<p>Across this full-length article, Adele Tomlin: sets herself up as the excluded yet most devoted; frames all others as either enablers, dollybirds, or asleep; and rewrites betrayal as a rite of passage for the spiritually pure. She uses her emotional injury as devotional evidence, her academic labor as moral currency, her heartbreak as lineage prophecy. Adele Tomlin does not report Dharma news — she rewrites Dharma history around the central agony of not being chosen, ritually engineering your emotional reactions through spiritualized narcissism. What begins as spiritual journalism ends in eroticized grief theatre. The Dharma is not failing her — she is holding it hostage to the echo of her own heartbreak. Now, you know why she needs the Karmapa’s silence. His absence is her canvas. She becomes the only character speaking, and thus, the spiritual proxy.</p>

<p><strong>Public Warning</strong>: Mounting evidence of misconduct points to one painful and unavoidable conclusion. Over seven years of operation producing unauthorized dubious translations, Adele Tomlin has been abusing the sacred name of Dakini to infiltrate the Buddhist community and execute anti-Buddhadharma psychological operation to corrupt Vajrayana from within by: advocating twisted views, denigrating (past and present) lineage gurus, disseminating hearsays, seeding conflict, running political ads in coordination with multiple global admins on Facebook. Until statements of accountability are formally issued, association with such a <em>self-endorsed figure (mara) absent authentic lineage authorization</em> guarantees samaya breach, energetic contamination, karmic entanglement, merit dissolution, dualistic imprisonment, klesha accumulation, and spiritual atrophy.</p></div>
