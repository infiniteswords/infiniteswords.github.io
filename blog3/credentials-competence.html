<h1>Credentials vs Competence: Refuting Adele Tomlin’s Self-Proclaimed Authority</h1>
<p>Adele Tomlin repeatedly presents herself as a former barrister, a trained philosopher, a Tibetologist, and a professional Buddhist translator. On the surface, these titles serve to create a halo of legitimacy, especially in Dharma spaces where Western academic credentials and legal knowledge carry unusual symbolic power. But when examined against her public behavior, errors in reasoning, and rhetorical patterns, the contradiction becomes too obvious to ignore:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Her behavior systematically violates the standards associated with the very professions she claims.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<h2>Claim #1: “I Was a Barrister”</h2>
<p>Adele Tomlin claims she trained and worked as a barrister in the UK, a position that implies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fluency in reading legal texts, contracts, and court documents</li>
<li>Logical argumentation grounded in procedural clarity</li>
<li>Ethical standards around citation and representation of facts</li>
</ul>
<p>But in her writings on the Karmapa court cases, she:</p>
<ul>
<li>Treats civil filings as convictions<br/>(<em>e.g., framing motions or complaints as if they are judicial conclusions</em>)</li>
<li>Quotes selectively from judgments while ignoring exculpatory or neutral content</li>
<li>Uses loaded moral language without legal basis</li>
<li>Fails to distinguish between allegation, finding, and procedural delay</li>
</ul>
<p>In several instances, she mistakes procedural events for moral proof, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assuming that a group filing a petition “proves” their guilt or ill motive</li>
<li>Misunderstanding <em>lis pendens</em> (pending litigation) as an automatic indictment</li>
<li>Ignoring <strong>burden of proof standards</strong>, as if mere accusation equals factual wrongdoing</li>
</ul>
<h3>A barrister would never do this.</h3>
<p>This level of misunderstanding is not just sloppy; it violates the foundational training of a legal professional. And if she was indeed trained, then what we are witnessing is worse than incompetence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is <strong>strategic distortion</strong>, used to sway public emotion against her perceived enemies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For evidence, witness her own accusatory comments: in response <a href="../blog1/outsourcing-dangers.html">to a commenter on her webpage</a> and <a href="../blog1/venomous-vessel.html">to the pro-Karmapa team</a>.</p>
<h2>Claim #2: “I’m a Professional Translator”</h2>
<p>Tomlin positions herself as a high-level translator of Tibetan Buddhist texts. This claim implies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rigorous discipline of precision, especially when interpreting sacred or formal texts</li>
<li>Ability to distinguish literal meaning from interpretive overlay</li>
<li>Respect for context, lineage attribution, and authorial voice</li>
<li>Sensitivity to nuance, connotation, and terminological clarity</li>
</ul>
<p>But in public writings, she:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regularly inserts her personal beliefs, projections, and emotional interpretations into translated contexts</li>
<li>Conflates symbolic and literal language, especially around tantra and consort dynamics</li>
<li>Claims a high standard of understanding while frequently mistranslating doctrinal positions (e.g., equating “union” with romantic or devotional longing)</li>
<li>Dismisses scholarly caution as “rigid” or “male-centric,” instead favoring her own mythic voice</li>
</ul>
<p>Most damningly:<br/>She misinterprets <strong>English-language court documents</strong> while claiming to translate Tibetan scripture.<br/>How can one be trusted to render esoteric Tibetan nuance when they <strong>misrepresent basic legal English</strong>?</p>
<p>For evidence, see <a href="audit-mastertable.html">our audit of her 899 posts</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Claim #3: “I’m a Philosopher and Tibetologist”</h2>
<p>Adele lists a BA in Philosophy from King’s College and a Master’s in Tibetology from the University of Hamburg, both legitimate qualifications if used with intellectual integrity.</p>
<p>A philosopher’s toolkit includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clarity in reasoning</li>
<li>Separation of argument from emotion</li>
<li>Awareness of cognitive bias and fallacy</li>
</ul>
<p>A Tibetologist is expected to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ground assertions in documented lineage history</li>
<li>Avoid anachronism, projection, or tampering with sources</li>
<li>Present balanced analysis between ritual form, cultural context, and doctrinal function</li>
</ul>
<p>But in her writings:</p>
<ul>
<li>She frequently employs <strong>false dichotomies</strong> (“women vs patriarchal Gelugpa,” “feminine truth vs male rigidity”)</li>
<li>She projects <strong>emotional wounds</strong> onto sacred structures (e.g., her longing becoming the basis for tantric consort theory)</li>
<li>She imposes <strong>modern feminist language onto pre-modern tantric texts</strong>, distorting their meaning for self-framing</li>
<li>She rejects all critique as <strong>sectarian, misogynistic, or “jealous”</strong>, avoiding philosophical engagement entirely</li>
</ul>
<p>These are not the moves of a philosopher. They are the moves of <strong>a narrative controller</strong>.</p>
<p>For evidence, witness how she <a href="seduced-absence.html">interprets on the Karmapa’s silence</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>What These Contradictions Reveal</h2>
<p>A pattern emerges:</p>
<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Claimed Credential</th><th>Expected Behavior</th><th>Her Actual Behavior</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Barrister</strong></td><td>Precision, neutrality, legal clarity</td><td>Emotional distortion of legal documents</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Translator</strong></td><td>Textual accuracy, linguistic humility</td><td>Poetic self-insertion, mistranslation of evidence</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Philosopher</strong></td><td>Argumentation, balance, insight</td><td>Victim narrative, false binaries</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Tibetologist</strong></td><td>Scholarly rigor, lineage care</td><td>Mythic projection, revisionist lineage claims</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>In short:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Adele Tomlin uses titles as costume, not as discipline.<br/>Her actions consistently betray the very competencies those titles imply.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In simpler terms: <strong>Adele Tomlin is a pathological liar</strong>.</p>
<p>This is not casual defamation, but a forensic diagnosis based on observable patterns. She fabricates roles (barrister, philosopher, translator, Tibetologist), then performs selective theater to maintain those illusions. Her lies are not accidental. They are <strong>systemic</strong> (across platforms), <strong>instrumental</strong> (used to manipulate authority), and <strong>ritualistic</strong> (repeated in coded, symbolic ways).</p>
<p>Each title she adopts is a mask and behind each mask is a calculated distortion of truth. The gap between her claimed expertise and actual behavior is not just large. It is <em>the structure of her influence</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is not misunderstanding. It is performance fraud in the realm of sacred authority.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Ethical Implications</h2>
<p>If Adele Tomlin were anonymous, this would be a private matter. But she has built an entire blog empire claiming sacred knowledge, insider access, and spiritual authority, often aimed at manipulating public views of lineage figures. To challenge her based on behavior, not identity, is not only ethical but essential.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not what someone <em>claims</em> to be that matters.<br/>It is how they <em>behave under scrutiny</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Adele Tomlin may very well have studied law, translation, and philosophy.<br/>But she behaves not as a professional in those fields but as a <strong>myth-maker in search of validation</strong>. And that contradiction is the crack where truth enters.</p>

<p><strong>Public Warning</strong>: Mounting evidence of misconduct points to one painful and unavoidable conclusion. Over seven years of operation producing unauthorized dubious translations, Adele Tomlin has been abusing the sacred name of Dakini to infiltrate the Buddhist community and execute anti-Buddhadharma psychological operation to corrupt Vajrayana from within by: advocating twisted views, denigrating (past and present) lineage gurus, disseminating hearsays, seeding conflict, running political ads in coordination with multiple global admins on Facebook. Until statements of accountability are formally issued, association with such a <em>self-endorsed figure (mara) absent authentic lineage authorization</em> guarantees samaya breach, energetic contamination, karmic entanglement, merit dissolution, dualistic imprisonment, klesha accumulation, and spiritual atrophy.</p></div>
