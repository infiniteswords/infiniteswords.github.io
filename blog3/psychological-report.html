<h1>Forensic Psychological Dissection Report</h1>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Adele Tomlin<br/><strong>Date:</strong> July 2025<br/><strong>Prepared in the Public Interest</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>I. Subject Profile Summary</strong></p>
<p>Adele Tomlin is a UK-born individual publicly identifying as a Buddhist translator, writer, poet, and practitioner. She operates under the platform “Dakini Translations,” where she self-publishes translations, editorial commentary, and polemical essays. She has contributed to Buddhist Door Global, Tricycle Magazine, and other digital outlets. Her online presence involves frequent autobiographical narration, claims of spiritual intimacy with the 17th Karmapa (Ogyen Trinley Dorje), and critique of institutional Buddhism, especially Gelug-affiliated organizations.</p>
<p>She publicly asserts credentials as a former lawyer, trained philosopher, academic Tibetologist, and Vajrayana practitioner. She also styles herself as a “wisdom consort,” a term traditionally reserved for qualified tantric partners within restricted esoteric contexts.</p>
<p><strong>II. Observed Behavioral Patterns</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Self-Mythologizing</strong>
<ul>
<li>Progressive public elevation from translator to “wisdom consort.”</li>
<li>Narrative arc framed as martyrdom and prophetic insight.</li>
<li>Recurring references to mystical dreams, karmic destiny, or cosmic injustice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Spiritual Appropriation and Erotic Transference</strong>
<ul>
<li>Language blending sexual intimacy and guru devotion.</li>
<li>Deployment of Vajrayana symbolism (e.g., union, bliss, dakini) to imply proximity and privilege.</li>
<li>Elevation of personal relationships into metaphysical significance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Persecution Complex and Triangulation</strong>
<ul>
<li>Claims of being targeted, silenced, or persecuted by Gelug institutions, male hierarchies, and online critics.</li>
<li>Attempts to mobilize audiences into action via outrage (e.g., petitions, open letters).</li>
<li>Framing critiques as spiritual attacks or violations of sacred feminine authority.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Credibility Conflicts</strong>
<ul>
<li>Claims former legal training but misinterprets legal documents, confusing allegations with adjudicated facts.</li>
<li>Presents herself as a translator yet demonstrates selective, tendentious renderings of Tibetan materials.</li>
<li>Uses academic affiliation and credentialing inconsistently, often bypassing scholarly method.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>III. Contradictions and Inconsistencies</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Publicly positions herself as apolitical yet repeatedly inserts conspiratorial political narratives.</li>
<li>Claims rigorous academic standards while dismissing scholarly peer review and editorial oversight.</li>
<li>Demands transparency from institutions while avoiding direct answers to serious public questions about her own positioning.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IV. Manipulation Tactics Identified</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FOG (Fear, Obligation, Guilt):</strong> Implied spiritual consequences for dissent.</li>
<li>DARVO (Deny – Attack – Reverse Victim/Offender), which can manifest as: 
<ul>
<li><strong>Gaslighting:</strong> Dismissing factual inquiry as aggression or jealousy.</li>
<li><strong>Spiritual Blackmail:</strong> Conflating criticism with betrayal of the sacred feminine or Dharma.</li>
<li><strong>Emotional Baiting:</strong> Publishing provocative personal revelations to disarm scrutiny.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>V. Psychological Risk Markers (Public Behavioral Indicators)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Narrative Control Obsession:</strong> Comment deletions, pressure on social media moderators, suppression of dissenting discourse.</li>
<li><strong>Identity Fusion:</strong> No clear separation between personal emotions and religious claims.</li>
<li><strong>Projection:</strong> Regularly accuses others of the exact tactics she deploys (e.g., censorship, spiritual abuse).</li>
<li><strong>Messianic Framing:</strong> References to cosmic purpose, divine mandate, or being a voice for the voiceless.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>VI. Impact Assessment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>On Readers:</strong> Erosion of critical thinking; increased emotional dependency on her narrative.</li>
<li><strong>On Dharma Spaces:</strong> Confusion of tantric symbolism; erosion of boundaries between teacher, translator, and consort roles.</li>
<li><strong>On Lineage Integrity:</strong> Undermining of institutional credibility through false intimacy and self-positioning.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>VII. Conclusion &amp; Public Recommendation</strong></p>
<p>This psychological analysis reveals a systematic pattern of manipulative narrative construction, symbolic appropriation, and unsubstantiated credential inflation within Adele Tomlin’s writings. The fusion of erotic transference, spiritual authority, and persecution narratives constitutes a serious psychological risk to vulnerable individuals and undermines the integrity of Vajrayana discourse.</p>
<p>Engagement with her content is strongly discouraged. Any interaction exposes readers to psychological manipulation. Cross-check all claims against verified sources and scrutinize the manipulative structures beneath the surface language.</p>

<div class="stamp">
<p><strong>Public Warning</strong>: Mounting evidence of misconduct points to one painful and unavoidable conclusion. Over seven years of operation producing unauthorized dubious translations, Adele Tomlin has been abusing the sacred name of Dakini to infiltrate the Buddhist community and execute anti-Buddhadharma psychological operation to corrupt Vajrayana from within by: advocating twisted views, denigrating (past and present) lineage gurus, disseminating hearsays, seeding conflict, running political ads in coordination with multiple global admins on Facebook. Until statements of accountability are formally issued, association with such a <em>self-endorsed figure (mara) absent authentic lineage authorization</em> guarantees samaya breach, energetic contamination, karmic entanglement, merit dissolution, dualistic imprisonment, klesha accumulation, and spiritual atrophy.</p></div>
