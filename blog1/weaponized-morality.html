<h1>Weaponized Morality and Psychological Manipulation in Buddhist Circles: A Penetrative Analysis of Adele Tomlin’s Behavior</h1>

<p>A commenter left a series of striking insights on my Facebook post. As someone familiar with the Tibetan Buddhist world, his analysis of Adele Tomlin is not only informed but also deeply disturbing. I felt it important to preserve and share it here in full for serious consideration.</p><p>The views expressed below are those of an individual insider and do not reflect legal claims but observations based on years of public behavior, community interactions, and social impact. </p><p>-- </p><p>I’ve had very similar experiences with this person, and have come to the same unsettling conclusions. In my view, this individual is among the most dangerous, problematic and unethical figures in the entire Buddhist world—especially in the field of translation. Extreme caution is strongly advised.</p><p>---</p><p>There are serious concerns regarding Adele Tomlin's conduct over the last 12+ years (since at least 2012). She is widely known within the Tibetan and broader Buddhist communities for spreading false rumors, making baseless accusations, and engaging in disinformation campaigns against many people and groups. For many years, she has consistently used her platform, social media presence, and online activity to launch personal attacks against various individuals, including respected Tibetan lamas, Buddhist teachers, translators and scholars.</p><p>Her toxic and unethical behavior has contributed to a climate of fear, mistrust and hostility in many circles, undermining the potential for constructive dialogue and community-building. Multiple instances have been documented where she has engaged in defamatory speech, slander and incitement against both individuals and groups, often targeting those who do not share her views or who belong to different Buddhist lineages, including a great many innocent people with the misfortune to cross her path.</p><p>She has consistently used her platform to advance personal agendas, distorting information to fit her narrative rather than contributing to balanced and respectful discourse. Her tendency to promote unverified claims, conspiracy theories and personal accusations (without credible evidence) contributes to misinformation, which can mislead and confuse the community. Such actions are detrimental to the values of compassion, empathy and understanding that are central to Buddhism.</p><p>In addition, Tomlin has a troubling history of targeting vulnerable individuals within the Buddhist community, often exploiting their personal circumstances and gathering information from them, in order to further her own agenda. Her involvement in organized harassment campaigns against perceived adversaries, often conducted through social media and other platforms, had led to an increase of negativity and hostility throughout the Tibetan and Buddhist communities. Unfortunately, this has often produced an atmosphere of mistrust among various individuals and social circles.</p><p>Tomlin has shown little to no accountability or remorse toward her victims, despite numerous complaints and documented instances of problematic behavior over a long period of time. Her long-standing pattern of abusive and antagonistic actions has created a culture of fear among those who may disagree with or challenge her, discouraging open expression and participation in public discourse.</p><p>It is critical for BuddhistDoor (and other publications that have published Tomlin's work) to consider the reputational risks associated with giving a platform to such individuals, especially those who have a long and documented history of spreading disinformation and engaging in harmful conduct.</p><p>--- </p><p>It is not sufficient to attribute the troubling behavior of Adele Tomlin in question solely to mental instability or eccentricity. While schizophrenia-spectrum traits may be present — including signs of delusional ideation, persecutory complexes, cognitive disorganization, and dissociative tendencies — these alone do not account for the consistent patterns of manipulation, aggression, and interpersonal harm observed over time.</p><p>Instead, the situation reveals a more disturbing and complex profile: the intersection of psychological disturbance with high verbal intelligence, social strategy, and a compulsion for control. When mental illness coexists with intelligence, particularly verbal and rhetorical aptitude, the result can be the weaponization of narratives, ideological frameworks, and even communities themselves.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>CLUSTER B TRAITS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL OVERLAP</b></p><p>Features characteristic of Cluster B personality disorders — particularly antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) and narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) — are strongly suggested. In some cases, traits associated with borderline personality disorder (BPD) may also be present, though to a lesser degree.</p><p>Antisocial traits are evidenced by a repeated disregard for the emotional safety of others, a willingness to violate social norms, calculated manipulation, and a conspicuous lack of remorse or empathy.</p><p>Narcissistic features may be indicated by a sense of inflated self-importance, hypersensitivity to criticism, the belief in being uniquely persecuted or enlightened, and a chronic need for validation, often framed in moral or spiritual terms.</p><p>Borderline tendencies might be inferred from the oscillation between idealization and devaluation of others, as well as unstable interpersonal dynamics — though in this case, the behavior tends more toward strategic hostility than emotional impulsivity.</p><p>What emerges is a profile of someone who is not simply “unwell” in the conventional sense, but someone who engages in organized, strategic disruption; often behind a veneer of moral or ideological concern.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>THE ROLE OF STRATEGIC INTELLIGENCE</b></p><p>When psychological dysfunction is paired with rhetorical skill, the resulting behaviors can be particularly destructive — especially within spiritual, academic, or activist contexts. A person fitting this description may learn to cloak aggression in the language of ethics, social justice, or spirituality, thus deflecting scrutiny and framing dissent as persecution.</p><p>In such instances, accusations are made not simply to express grievance, but to reshape narratives, disempower rivals, and construct loyalty structures. The initial presentation may appear as sincere critique — often grounded in valid concerns — but over time, the behavior escalates to include:</p><p>- Patterned targeting of individuals and institutions</p><p>- Use of ideological or religious language to reframe personal vendettas</p><p>- Exploitation of social vulnerabilities within communities</p><p>- Rejection of feedback or accountability</p><p>- Increasing emotional volatility and conspiratorial thinking</p><p>This behavioral arc creates a toxic feedback loop, where isolation leads to more extreme actions, and those actions lead to further isolation. The trajectory, once set, is difficult to reverse — particularly when the individual resists treatment or lacks basic insight into their own condition, which appears to be true here.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>TIMELINE OF ESCALATION</b></p><p>In similar cases, the development often follows a recognizable trajectory. In Adele's particular case, it seems to have followed a consistent pattern of increasing escalation, deception, attention-seeking, hostility and personal vendettas towards an increasingly large number of individuals over time:</p><p>Initial Phase (e.g., 2012–2014): Critical engagement with broad cultural or institutional issues. Content may appear provocative but stays within normative discourse.</p><p>Intermediate Phase (e.g., 2015–2018): Increasing personalization of critiques, emergence of repeated conflicts, and signs of "splitting" behavior. Interpersonal attacks become more prominent and often behind-the-scenes.</p><p>Late Phase (e.g., 2019 onward): Escalation of controversy, repeated targeting of individuals, multiple failed relationships or affiliations, and near-total loss of credibility within the original community.</p><p>The transition from general critique to personalized vendetta often coincides with mounting psychological distress and the breakdown of social bonds. The environment around the person — spiritual groups, activist circles, academic communities — may gradually withdraw, not necessarily out of ideological disagreement, but due to repeated violations of trust and communal safety.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>DANGEROUS INTERSECTION OF TRAITS</b></p><p>Such a profile is marked not only by its destructiveness, but by its resilience to intervention. The presence of:</p><p>- High intelligence</p><p>- Deep emotional dysregulation</p><p>- Tactical manipulation</p><p>- Ideological and religious weaponization</p><p>- Persistent lack of empathy or conscience</p><p>...makes the individual exceptionally difficult to engage with constructively. Their narratives often contain partial truths, which make them more believable — especially to outsiders unfamiliar with their history or interpersonal dynamics.</p><p>Over time, communities begin to recognize the recurring patterns: new targets are identified, allies are alienated, and ideological or spiritual language is turned into a mechanism of control or justification. Attempts at resolution are often met with accusations, deflection, or renewed aggression.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>COLLAPSE AND ISOLATION</b></p><p>Eventually, the cumulative effects of this behavior result in social collapse. Once-supportive communities — including spiritual traditions, lineages, or academic institutions — begin to disengage or actively distance themselves. In the most severe cases, the individual is left in social, emotional, and professional isolation, surrounded only by enablers or passive observers.</p><p>At this stage, the pattern is generally irreversible without intensive psychological intervention, which is rarely sought by individuals who view themselves as fundamentally “right” or "justified" and others as uniformly malicious or ignorant.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>IMPLICATIONS</b></p><p>Situations like this reveal the unique dangers posed by untreated mental illness when combined with charisma, linguistic skill, ideological familiarity or philosophical training. Individuals fitting this description can significantly damage not only the reputations and careers of many people, but also the psychological safety of entire communities. Often, their most harmful actions are invisible to the broader public until well after the damage has been done.</p><p>This pattern is well-documented in psychological literature, particularly in studies of "high-functioning" personality disorders within spiritual, activist, and academic spaces. What distinguishes these individuals is not the presence of illness alone, but the capacity to mask, rationalize, and strategically deploy that illness as a weapon.</p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>KEY TAKEAWAYS</b></p><p>Adele Tomlin exhibits long-term patterns of rhetorical manipulation, targeted hostility, and community disruption. Traits strongly suggest antisocial and narcissistic behaviors, alongside strategic weaponization of spiritual language. Her actions have caused measurable harm in Buddhist and translation circles for over a decade. Communities and platforms must consider the reputational and ethical risks of giving a platform to such individuals. </p>

<div class="stamp">
<p><strong>Public Warning</strong>: Mounting evidence of misconduct points to one painful and unavoidable conclusion. Over seven years of operation producing unauthorized dubious translations, Adele Tomlin has been abusing the sacred name of Dakini to infiltrate the Buddhist community and execute anti-Buddhadharma psychological operation to corrupt Vajrayana from within by: advocating twisted views, denigrating (past and present) lineage gurus, disseminating hearsays, seeding conflict, running political ads in coordination with multiple global admins on Facebook. Until statements of accountability are formally issued, association with such a <em>self-endorsed figure (mara) absent authentic lineage authorization</em> guarantees samaya breach, energetic contamination, karmic entanglement, merit dissolution, dualistic imprisonment, klesha accumulation, and spiritual atrophy.</p></div>
