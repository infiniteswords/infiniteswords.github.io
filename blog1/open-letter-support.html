<h1>Open Letter to Those Considering Supporting Dakini Translations</h1>

<p>If you’ve arrived at the donation page of Dakini Translations of Adele Tomlin, reading the slogan...</p><blockquote><p>"Female-founded, -centred and oriented towards re-balancing with the feminine principle,"</p></blockquote><p>you might be drawn in by the promises of empowerment, spiritual re-alignment, and altruistic service. At first glance, these claims sound noble, even essential for the current moment. But before you decide to donate, I ask you to pause and reflect critically on what’s really behind this narrative.</p><p>Yes, the idea of “re-balancing with the feminine principle” is appealing, especially when it seems to offer a correction to centuries of patriarchal structures within spirituality. But let's be clear: the feminine principle in its true spiritual form is not about <a href="scaled-moaned.html">using sexuality or seductive imagery to attract attention, manipulate followers, or silence dissent</a>. True feminine power, as understood in Vajrayana Buddhism and in spiritual traditions more broadly, is about wisdom, compassion, insight, and integrity. It’s about serving the teachings, not elevating oneself through personal allure.</p><p>Sadly, the figure behind Dakini Translations has consistently used a sexualized approach in her work and media—using images, music, and symbols that evoke primal desires rather than spiritual awakening. Is this really the <a href="feminism-weaponized.html">"feminine" energy we want to promote</a>? Or is it a manipulative tactic aimed at disarming criticism and drawing followers into a controlled environment? Is this the rebalancing we need in the world of Vajrayana Buddhism?</p><p>Moreover, while the page touts being “non-profit” and “free to read,” the reality is that these terms often mask a deeper agenda: building influence, garnering attention, and exploiting a spiritual platform for personal gain. True non-profit organizations in the spiritual realm serve the teachings, not the ego. If the goal were truly to serve the community, one would expect more transparency and authenticity in both the teachings and the way they are shared.</p><p>This is not a call to dismiss the importance of women’s leadership in Buddhism—quite the opposite. What we need is genuine, unselfish spiritual leadership that does not <a href="persistent-sexualization.html">distort the teachings or use gender and empowerment as a façade for personal gain</a>.</p><p>Before contributing, I encourage you to dig deeper. Look past the slogans and ask: Is the message truly in alignment with the values of compassion, wisdom, and integrity? Are you supporting the teachings of Vajrayana Buddhism or just the perpetuation of someone’s personal agenda? The spiritual community deserves better, and we must be mindful of where our energy and resources go.</p><p>Thank you for taking the time to read this and reflect before making your decision.</p><p><br/></p><p>David D. ~ Vajrayana’s designated stool handler</p>

<div class="stamp">
<p><strong>Public Warning</strong>: Mounting evidence of misconduct points to one painful and unavoidable conclusion. Over seven years of operation producing unauthorized dubious translations, Adele Tomlin has been abusing the sacred name of Dakini to infiltrate the Buddhist community and execute anti-Buddhadharma psychological operation to corrupt Vajrayana from within by: advocating twisted views, denigrating (past and present) lineage gurus, disseminating hearsays, seeding conflict, running political ads in coordination with multiple global admins on Facebook. Until statements of accountability are formally issued, association with such a <em>self-endorsed figure (mara) absent authentic lineage authorization</em> guarantees samaya breach, energetic contamination, karmic entanglement, merit dissolution, dualistic imprisonment, klesha accumulation, and spiritual atrophy.</p></div>
