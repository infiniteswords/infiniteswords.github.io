<h1>Why Adele Tomlin Fears the Camera During Empowerments</h1>
<p><i>This is a public protection notice, issued in defense of the sanctity of Vajrayana transmissions and the safety of all practitioners who attend them.</i></p><p>Over the years, Adele Tomlin has positioned herself as a self-appointed mouthpiece of the Vajrayana tradition — a translator, a commentator, and an increasingly obsessive performer of <strong>pseudo-dakini narratives</strong> that consistently blur the lines between sanctity and sacrilege, where personal longings masquerade as lineage revelations.</p><p>She writes prolifically about her proximity to high lamas, receiving countless initiations, and her “superhuman” access to sacred ceremonies through her so-called <strong>central channel</strong>. Yet one thing remains disturbingly consistent: </p><p><strong data-end="220" data-start="178">She Carefully Controls How She Appears</strong></p><p></p><div>Adele doesn’t avoid cameras entirely — she controls the context. She may appear in posed group photos before or after rituals, but she consistently avoids documentation during the empowerment itself. When candid moments arise, she’s conveniently outside the frame. Some witnesses even recall her declining to be photographed, citing “sacredness” as the reason. But sacredness doesn’t require personal invisibility.</div><strong data-end="663" data-start="646"><div><strong data-end="663" data-start="646">Fantasy does.</strong></div><div><strong data-end="663" data-start="646"><br/></strong></div></strong><p></p><h2><strong>The “Sacredness” Excuse Or a Shield for Compulsion?</strong></h2><p></p><div>Adele claims photographs shouldn't be taken out of “respect for the ritual.”</div><div>It sounds noble — until you realize: she applies this only to herself. She tells others not to photograph <em>her</em>. Not the lama. Not the altar. Just <em>her</em>. Sacredness doesn't require invisibility. But compulsive projection does. In truth, Vajrayana restricts <em>doctrinal content</em> — not faces. Lamas are photographed. Monasteries document empowerments.</div>
<div>What’s not normal is one laywoman exempting herself — and invoking sacredness to hide. She attends empowerments, writes eroticized reflections about being penetrated by the lama’s mindstream, then demands no one record her? That’s not sacredness. That’s stage control. “She doesn’t want to protect the empowerment from being filmed. She wants to protect the empowerment from being rewatched — <em>with her in it</em>.”</div><div><br/></div><blockquote><p></p></blockquote><h2><strong>The Erotic Compulsion She Can’t Control</strong></h2><p>In her own words, Adele describes empowerments not as blessings, but as <strong>psychic-sexual penetrations</strong>. She speaks of transmissions as “erotic energy.” She ascribes <strong>orgasmic charge</strong> to lamas’ voices. The lama becomes her symbolic lover. The empowerment becomes her <strong>private trance stage</strong>. And on that stage — <strong>no witnesses can exist</strong>. This is not Vajrayana. This is <strong>spiritualized masturbation</strong>, disguised as devotion — and enabled by collective silence. One camera would destroy the illusion. One photo would <strong>rupture the erotic trance</strong> she projects onto sacred transmission.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h2><strong>Why She Truly Fears the Camera</strong></h2><p>MANY attendees — monastics and lay alike — have witnessed it firsthand: Eyes wide. Face contorted. Body trembling. Not in devotion. Not in meditative absorption. But in something disturbingly personal. <strong>Gaping. Stiff. Lost in inner simulation. </strong>A moment not of transmission — but of self-stimulation. And the camera? It would’ve captured <strong>everything</strong>. This is why she fears the lens. Not out of reverence. Not out of humility. But because it would reveal what she’s <em>actually</em> doing. <strong>It’s not spiritual practice, but</strong><strong> stage-managed auto-eroticism, </strong>which collapses the moment anyone else holds the camera.</p><p><br/></p><blockquote><p></p>
</blockquote><h2>UNRELEASED FOOTAGE EXISTS</h2><p>Little does she know: Adele Tomlin has already been documented — meticulously, repeatedly — performing what amounts to sacrilege. The only reason the footage hasn’t surfaced is because, until now, people chose pity over exposure. Chose to spare her dignity. That mercy is running out, however. We have received multiple copies of the recorded footage, both photos and videos, revealing how Adele Tomlin has exhibited <strong>visibly compulsive behavior</strong> during empowerments, including:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Facial gaping accompanied by uncontrolled muscle tension in the jaw and lips</p></li><li><p>Eyes half-closed or rolled back, as if lost in internal stimulation rather than prayer</p></li><li><p><span>Rigid, trance-like stillness, sometimes lasting for extended periods with no outward awareness of the ritual context</span></p></li><li><p><span>Repetitive swaying, trembling, or breath patterns aligned with internal arousal rather than mantra recitation</span></p></li><li><p><span>Total absorption in her own bodily sensations, with no visible connection to the actual teachings or instructions being given</span></p></li></ul><div></div><div><div>Again, out of respect for the mandala, they have not been released. YET!</div><div>We are here to <strong>protect the sanctity of the space</strong>. But let it be known: </div><div><blockquote><strong>The silence will not last forever!</strong></blockquote></div><div>The tragedy is, no one needed to humiliate her. She’s been doing that herself — for years — on autopilot. What she believes is mysterious looks grotesque to the rest of the room. What she calls a transmission reads as trance-addiction. What she thinks is sacred eroticism lands as spiritualized exhibitionism. No one interrupted her. No one needed to. Because when the illusion breaks, all that remains is embarrassment. </div><div><blockquote><p>And the worst kind of humiliation? The one you stage for yourself — believing it’s divine.</p></blockquote><p> </p></div></div><blockquote><p></p>
</blockquote><h2><strong>There are eyes now. Cameras. Observers.</strong></h2><p>Let This Be Your Final Performance, Adele!</p><p>You built your persona on the illusion of sacred femininity. You turned the transmission hall into your personal stage. You danced for imaginary lovers and mistook silence for reverence.</p><p>You’re not mesmerizing. You’re embarrassing.</p><p>What you call “transmission” is compulsion. What you call “devotion” is performance.</p><p>I’m not impressed. I’m repulsed. And I will never look at you the same again.</p><blockquote><p>Let this be the end of your fantasy!</p></blockquote><p> </p><div><blockquote data-end="1031" data-start="324"><blockquote><p data-end="1031" data-start="995"></p></blockquote><p data-end="1031" data-start="995"></p></blockquote></div><h2>Let the Lens Protect the Lineage</h2><p></p><div>We don’t ask for cameras to embarrass anyone.</div><div>We ask because <strong>fantasy dies when seen</strong>.</div><p></p><p></p><div>A single photo punctures the trance.</div><div>A single recording breaks the spell.</div><div>It shifts focus from <strong>drama</strong> back to <strong>Dharma</strong>.</div><p></p><blockquote>
<p></p><div>“She demands to be the mouthpiece of the lineage —</div><div>but refuses to show her face during transmission?</div><div>That’s like applying for a job and hiding under the desk during the interview.”</div></blockquote><p> </p><h2>ARE WE AGAINST EROTICISM?</h2><p>The problem isn’t an interest in eroticism or sex. That’s natural. Even sexually liberal cultures know how to contain it — through structure, consent, and private ritual. Sophisticated Europeans with strong appetites organize discrete spaces to explore them — not desecrate sacred ground with them. What’s dangerous is the deliberate collapse of boundaries between sacred and profane — the public violation of dignity through songs, images, and performances that drag spiritual aspiration into the mud of exhibitionism. Adele Tomlin isn’t liberating anything. She’s grooming people to become uncivilized, low-minded caricatures — proud of their vulgarity, blind to their descent, and convinced their degradation is wisdom. This isn’t dakini work. It’s tantric sabotage — dressed in unauthorized translations, unverified narratives, and eroticized transgressions designed to corrupt the field of devotion and sever the path to inner awakening. What she’s cultivating is not realization — it’s rebirth into lower realms, driven by the very poisons she pretends to expose: ignorance, greed, and hatred.</p><p><br/></p><h2>Public Advisory</h2><p></p><div><strong>If you see Adele Tomlin at a Vajrayana empowerment, observe her carefully.</strong></div><div>If possible, <strong>record the event — photo or video</strong> — to protect the space and deter abuse.</div><p></p><blockquote>
<p></p><div>This is not surveillance.</div><div>This is <strong>lineage protection</strong>.</div><p></p>

<p><strong>Public Warning</strong>: Mounting evidence of misconduct points to one painful and unavoidable conclusion. Over seven years of operation producing unauthorized dubious translations, Adele Tomlin has been abusing the sacred name of Dakini to infiltrate the Buddhist community and execute anti-Buddhadharma psychological operation to corrupt Vajrayana from within by: advocating twisted views, denigrating (past and present) lineage gurus, disseminating hearsays, seeding conflict, running political ads in coordination with multiple global admins on Facebook. Until statements of accountability are formally issued, association with such a <em>self-endorsed figure (mara) absent authentic lineage authorization</em> guarantees samaya breach, energetic contamination, karmic entanglement, merit dissolution, dualistic imprisonment, klesha accumulation, and spiritual atrophy.</p></div>
