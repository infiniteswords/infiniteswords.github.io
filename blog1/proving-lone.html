<h1>How Does Adele Tomlin Prove Herself to be a Lone Harmless Woman?</h1>


<p>A commenter shared their thoughts on my YouTube video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKg9wWl0Ws0">Unresolved Questions Pending Dakini Translations Adele Tomlin's Public Statement and Apology</a>. Personally, I don't believe my video has garnered much public interest, as reflected by the modest number of views. However, this commenter seems to think that the video plays a crucial role in amplifying attention, thereby helping Adele Tomlin grow. Furthermore, they suggest that I stay silent, leave Adele alone - she will likely change for the better and everyone is benefited. Mmm... Does this sound familiar?</p><p></p><blockquote>"@kunzangdordze9730 I don't think Adele Tomlin has an aim to destroy Budddhadharma, also she has no power to do so. She is just a person on the internet. Adele is obviously suffering from narcissistic personality disorder which inadvertently comes through in her blog posts. The more drama is created around her, the more she thrives on it. So I don't think videos like this one help the situation. Letting her be and paying no attention to her, would help. Without the drama, that she hankers after, she might find a space to reflect about herself and maybe correct her ways at least somewhat."</blockquote><p></p><p><br/></p><p>First, let me rephrase their comments for easy point-to-point dissection.</p><p></p><blockquote><p>Adele has pure intention in the Dharma. </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>She is a lone woman, unable to do any harm to it.</p><p>She is a pitiable person suffering from mental instability, leaking out its helplessness through its posts.</p><p>The more attention you call out, the better she thrives. Leave her alone. Hopefully by ignoring whatever she does or writes, she will reflect back and correct herself on her own, at least a little improvement.</p></blockquote><p></p><p><br/></p><p>Do you agree? Would you like some time to think through your own opinions before reading what I think below?</p><p><br/></p><h3>1. Adele Tomlin of Dakini Translations has pure intention in the Buddhadharma.</h3><p>I am not enlightened. I am not her. I can't tell for sure. That's why I invite her to speak up and responsibly answer the list of unresolved questions. Because to me, Adele’s actions speak to <a href="two-names.html">a very different agenda</a> than the pure transmission of Buddhadharma. Why the need to censor dissenting views when people are free to choose what they think? ... Unless those views thwart her hidden malicious agenda; one of which thrives on the false impression of unanimous public support of her objectionable perversion.</p><p><br/></p><h3>2. Adele Tomlin is a lone woman, unable to do any harm to the Buddhadharma.</h3><p>Adele Tomlin has some obtrusive online platforms - such as the Facebook page around 21K followers, surpassing the number of followers of the Facebook groups Sikkimese Buddhist Community and Karmapa to rumtek - that even those two Facebook groups do not dare to ban her from posting questionable materials on their groups. Better go against the Buddha's teachings, propagate negative karma, drag others down hell, rather than offend such weak lone woman! Adele has been actively using the Karmapa's credibility as a tool to attract followers and attention, while promoting her own twisted perceptions, particularly sowing discord and inciting conflict among Vajrayana practitioners across different lineages. The Karmapa's name is a potent shield against questioning, especially from those deeply devoted to the Karmapa. Her online spiritual rehabilitation is carefully engineered to bring out the worst in people by glorifying, not merely normalizing, her distorted misinterpretations of the Buddhadharma, creating an environment full of hostility, not just doubt. Let's not forget her gracious provision of unauthorized translation texts, which karmically harm practitioners by association with her. Now, add censorship to the picture. An ultimate threat not just to the Buddhadharma but to the very integrity of Vajrayana Buddhism.</p><p>Take away the Karmapa affiliation, and what do you have? A powerless lone figure with no authority, no respect, no legitimate foundation. Without this potent shield to mislead others with false affiliations, Adele is truly a lone woman with no following at all. Even flies would stay away from any questionable rot, cautious of a predator cloaked under feces ready to pounce, why would you be trusting toward Adele? What we have is not a spiritual friend but a cannibal who swallows you (and your personal voice), turns you into a clone, and infest the entire Vajrayana community.</p><p><br/></p><h3>3. Adele Tomlin is a pitiable person suffering from mental instability, leaking out its helplessness through its posts.</h3><p>Is this a call for my sympathy? Or my abandonment of critical thinking? Mental instability doesn't absolve anyone from harmful actions. Besides, her censoring tactics, loaded wordings, misrepresenting herself to be affiliated with the Karmapa - all of these appear to coalesce into one common theme that disrupts the integrity of Vajrayana Buddhism. Is it not reasonable to suspect malicious intent when a mentally unstable Adele Tomlin possesses the rarest capability to summon strategic coincidences that converge on one focused theme of enforcing her twisted truths alone?</p><p><br/></p><h3>4. The more attention you call out, the better Adele Tomlin thrives. Leave her alone. Hopefully by ignoring whatever she does or writes, she will reflect back and correct herself on her own, at least a little improvement.</h3><p data-end="3906" data-start="3218">I truly wish that were the case. I’ve observed Adele Tomlin long enough to know that silence only feeds the filth. She started as a tiny speck of dust, but over time, she’s grown into a towering monument of stinking feces, cloaked in cheap brocade and drowning in synthetic, nauseating perfumes, with followers circling her like moths to flames. The longer we remain silent, the more gaslighting spreads. Adele deflects scrutiny by asserting herself as a realized dakini or a former sexual abuse victim, further twisting the narrative. Viewers begin to question their own sanity, wondering if they’ve been irreverent or too harsh by questioning the stench she’s emitting unceasingly.</p>
<p>I wasn’t compelled to speak up until several devoted friends approached me, not for spiritual knowledge, but for my experience in criminal psychology, which has trained me to handle the fecal matter of society. <a href='mission.html'>Adele Tomlin is the fecal matter in Vajrayana circles</a>. The issue isn’t the attention she gains from my critique; it’s where that attention is directed. Through silence, she manipulates the focus to revolve around her fabricated persona. Shit is shit, no matter how well it’s dressed up - it remains putrid. By speaking up, I rip out all the rotting sores beneath that alluring lingerie. To some, this is the spark to reclaim personal power, walking away from Adele Tomlin without guilt. To others, this is nothing new, just a numbing joke. Besides, why would Adele - with 21K followers - need someone with zero to give her more attention? If anything I do anything, it’s this: I starve her of adoration in the long run.</p><p><br/></p><h2>How Does Adele Tomlin Prove Herself to be a Lone Harmless Woman?</h2><p>It's time Adele Tomlin of <a href="distorted-translations.html">Dakini Translations to leave the Karmapa alone</a> - no more redundant retranslations recompilations of his teachings on her website. The Karmapa himself is a highly credible recognized spiritual leader in his own right and his teachings speak for themselves. Let the Karmapa's wisdom shine on its own without any parasitic intervention to profit off his name.</p><p><br/></p><h2>Why Bother Responding to Adele Tomlin?</h2><p>Some may wonder why I bother responding to someone like Adele Tomlin when so many remain silent. The truth is simple: no one wants to handle shit. And yet when it’s smeared across a sacred space, when it’s dressed up as Dharma and spoon-fed to sincere practitioners, someone has to clean it up. I’m not here to preach purity or play lineage police. I’m here because I’m willing to do the unpleasant work of calling it what it is, confronting it directly, and getting dirty in the process so others don’t have to. If pointing out spiritual trash makes me unclean - so be it. Better to <a href="mission.html">handle filth honestly than let it fester unchallenged in silence</a>.</p>

<div class="stamp">
<p><strong>Public Warning</strong>: Mounting evidence of misconduct points to one painful and unavoidable conclusion. Over seven years of operation producing unauthorized dubious translations, Adele Tomlin has been abusing the sacred name of Dakini to infiltrate the Buddhist community and execute anti-Buddhadharma psychological operation to corrupt Vajrayana from within by: advocating twisted views, denigrating (past and present) lineage gurus, disseminating hearsays, seeding conflict, running political ads in coordination with multiple global admins on Facebook. Until statements of accountability are formally issued, association with such a <em>self-endorsed figure (mara) absent authentic lineage authorization</em> guarantees samaya breach, energetic contamination, karmic entanglement, merit dissolution, dualistic imprisonment, klesha accumulation, and spiritual atrophy.</p></div>
