<h1>Open Letter to Publishers: Do Not Legitimize the Works of Adele Tomlin (Dakini Translations)</h1>

<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>

<p>I write to you not out of personal vendetta, but out of deep concern for the ethical and spiritual integrity of Tibetan Buddhism. You may be considering publishing or distributing works by Adele Tomlin, known online as “Dakini Translations.” I urge you, in no uncertain terms: do not publish her.</p><p>At first glance, Tomlin may appear to be a sincere contributor to the preservation and dissemination of Vajrayana teachings. The reality is far darker. Her conduct, methods, and motivations not only betray the sacred nature of the texts she handles, but also actively harm the communities she claims to serve.</p><h3>1. She distorts the teachings.</h3><p>Tomlin consistently inserts personal speculation, moralizing commentary, and unverified interpretations into the sacred texts of Tibetan Buddhism. What emerges is not translation, but contamination - spiritual material reframed through her psychological projections. She claims authenticity, yet distorts the source.</p><h3>2. She divides and harms communities.</h3><p>Tomlin has repeatedly engaged in public attacks on revered Tibetan lamas, including the 17th Karmapa and Sangye Nyenpa Rinpoche. She masks defamation as “investigation,” and censorship as “moderation.” She blocks, deletes, and silences any challenge to her authority, all while posturing as a victim and a feminist defender of justice.</p><h3>3. She has no recognized authority.</h3><p>Adele Tomlin is not endorsed by any legitimate translation body, or established Tibetan institutions. She has no formal retreat training, no monastic discipline, and no public recognition from respected lineage holders. Her qualifications are self-declared. Her platform is self-appointed.</p><h3>4. Publishing her work damages your reputation.</h3><p>Any organization that associates with her work risks reputational harm. You align yourself not with a scholar or a translator, but with someone known for spiritual distortion, online aggression, and sectarian disruption. You may think you’re printing harmless content - short praises, chants, or translations - but the vessel matters. <b>The water may appear clean, but the cup is leaking poison.</b><br><b>Just as you would not eat your own vomit, why consume the regurgitations of someone else’s spiritual confusion? And worse - why serve it to others under the guise of nourishment?</b></p><p>Publishing her work is not neutral. It is a karmic act with consequences - for your readers, your credibility, and your conscience. If you believe in the integrity of the dharma, in the sacredness of lineage, and in your own standards as a publisher, then this decision should be simple.</p><p>Protect the purity of your platform. Preserve the integrity of your imprint. Let your publishing be a vessel for authentic dharma, not distortion.</p><p>With conviction,</p><p>A practitioner committed to preserving the integrity of Tibetan Buddhism</p>

<div class="stamp">
<p><strong>Public Warning</strong>: Mounting evidence of misconduct points to one painful and unavoidable conclusion. Over seven years of operation producing unauthorized dubious translations, Adele Tomlin has been abusing the sacred name of Dakini to infiltrate the Buddhist community and execute anti-Buddhadharma psychological operation to corrupt Vajrayana from within by: advocating twisted views, denigrating (past and present) lineage gurus, disseminating hearsays, seeding conflict, running political ads in coordination with multiple global admins on Facebook. Until statements of accountability are formally issued, association with such a <em>self-endorsed figure (mara) absent authentic lineage authorization</em> guarantees samaya breach, energetic contamination, karmic entanglement, merit dissolution, dualistic imprisonment, klesha accumulation, and spiritual atrophy.</p></div>
