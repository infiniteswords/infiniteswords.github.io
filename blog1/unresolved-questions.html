<h1>Unresolved Questions Pending “Dakini Translations” Adele Tomlin’s Public Statement and Apology</h1>
<p>Today is April 23, 2025. Few days ago, Adele Tomlin (Dakini translations &amp; publications) emailed Henry Chia, a moderator in Karmapa Chenno group. She found out my posts warning others using her produced texts in the group and confronted Henry. As <a href="https://www.facebook.com/100001015547739/posts/10012628668780885/">Henry pointed out himself, she blocked him for his non-compliance</a>, thus has been banned from posting at <a href="https://web.facebook.com/groups/karmapa.chenno108/">Karmapa Chenno group</a>.</p>

<figure><img alt="" src="../images/img_1_1745260582319.jpg"/><figcaption>Fearing public scrutiny (Dakini Translations) Adele Tomlin as a group member instructed a group moderator, Henry Chia, to obliterate dissenting posts.</figcaption></figure>
<p>In my view, the email would sound like below, if being utterly blunt:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>“Hello Henry,</p>
<p>I hope you are suffering.</p>
<p>I was furious how you were being disloyal &amp; disobedient to me by liking the posts of nobody who reveals my true colors by encouraging readers to exercise own independent judgment.</p>
<p>I hereby command you to stop using your brain, simply follow my order to you to censor, delete, block all those empowering views that threaten my painstakingly built online persona as an unrivaled female dharma translator.</p>
<p>I thought you were a subservient instrument, but after I saw you <span>liked their posts[1]</span>, I can now see you are no longer useful to me in furthering my interests.</p>
<p>Explain yourself to me! Why do you suddently cease adoring me and begin utilizing your inferior brainpower to think and act for your own, after all those carefully orchestrated calculated attempts I have made you believe my story with SNR that you initially fell for?</p>
<p>You should always remain trusting with my judgment alone, because disobeying me, a female dharma translator, is heavy sin amounting to going against all teachings in general.</p>
<p>I instruct you not to reveal our abusive master-servant relationship known to public.</p>
<p>wicked wishes,</p>
<p>–“</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am quite surprised to find how she chooses to resort to underhand methods instead of open exchange in problem solving; this should say a lot about her deeper personality, don’t you agree?</p>
<p>First, why did Adele Tomlin email Henry for my posts? Any moderator has the right to refuse or approve posts in a group. How about a little respect for that and not feeling so entitled to being treated special all the time? Couldn’t she remorsefully reflect back on her shameful actions whether they are aligned with the spirit of bodhicitta as she unceasingly promotes divisiveness in our sangha through crafty wordings and insidious sarcasm? Do her actions represent an authentic dharma translator or rather a cunning dharma exploiter? Rather than approaching Henry to seek constructive feedback, she utilizes the common <strong>FOG tactics (Fear, Obligation, Guilt)</strong> to coerce Henry into compliance to block my posts. By <strong>Fear</strong> tactic, she asserts her privileged status as a female dharma translator, that going against her equals to harming the Buddhadharma. By <strong>Obligation</strong> tactic, she makes Henry feel obligated to comply because he previously had believed her one-sided story of being sexually abused by Sangye Nyenpa Rinpoche. By <strong>Guilt</strong> tactic, she makes Henry feel guilty for not empathising with and supporting her as a former sexual abuse victim. The fact that she habitually brings up this story whenever anyone going against her is a huge giveaway that it is an unequivocal lie. If believing the story demands siding with her every move, then she is obviously weaponizing such story <a href="venomous-vessel.html">for power and control.</a> All in all, her constant tone of talking down to readers is an insidious form of psychological bully. Nobody has bullied nor abused her; Adele Tomlin is the one who is constantly <a href="../blog2/reader-mindstate.html">bullying and abusing us readers</a>.</p>
<p>Second, why is Adele Tomlin scared that my alleged accusation (that she slandered the Karmapa yet paradoxically promoted his teachings and using his name in all her various initiatives to gain readers’ approval) be known to wider audience? As a supposedly trustworthy Dharma translator, wouldn’t it be more ethical and easier for Adele Tomlin to dismiss my accusations by clarifying openly to the public the reason for portraying the Karmapa as guilty for the sexual allegations despite the court document stating otherwise? She once blocked me already and now she is trying to snuff me out. How on earth have I slandered her? Slander implies making baseless accusations. I have always encouraged readers to verify whatever I say by examining her website, facebook posts, etc. If I am at all presenting flawed arguments against her, readers can tell on their own. Why the need to censor if whatever she does can stand the test of public scrutiny? Why can’t she be truthful enough to speak up and counter my arguments? Isn’t she an ex-lawyer? How can my flawed arguments possibly be able to manipulate readers in any way when readers possess sharp acuity to decide for themselves? Does she habitually see readers as unschooled toddlers? How insulting is she!</p>
<p>Finally, Now let’s compare my posts with her posts; how many of each of our posts are unsubstantiated, baseless lies, full of jealousy, etc.? I have nothing to hide; I need not block, delete comments, etc. I invite readers to decide for themselves. Yet, Adele Tomlin employs blocking, deleting, censoring tactics (going so far as to confront facebook group moderator and command) to silence any dissenting views, maliciously skewing readers’ judgment. Besides, my purpose is to encourage people to trust own judgment by going to the official sources of the Karmapa for any texts and teachings, while Adele Tomlin competes with the official sources by diverting readers away instead to rely on her texts on her website as much as possible without any formal disclosure. Isn’t she misleading the public by misrepresenting herself as, if not replacing, the Karmapa? Isn’t she unethically manipulatively offensively hijacking the Karmapa’s devotees?<br/>Why block me as my aim is to empower readers?<br/>Why support Adele Tomlin as her aim is to <span>cripple readers</span> [2]?</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS PENDING ADELE TOMLIN’S PUBLIC STATEMENT AND APOLOGY</p>
<p>In conclusion, here I present a list of unresolved questions which I expect Adele Tomlin to speak up and provide a responsible truthful explanation to the public. Until then, I strongly suggest you to disassociate away completely from such mara whose sole focus, apparently as you shall see with my questions. is to overthrow vajrayana buddhism, destroying your authentic study and practice.</p>
<p>Adele Tomlin, explain yourself to us before you penalize people for being disobedient to you. Why do you treat the allegations against the Karmapa as facts while the <a href="venomous-vessel.html">court document clearly shows otherwise</a>? Why promote the Karmapa’s teachings while painting him full of flaws? Why use the Karmapa’s name in your various questionable initiatives? what is the purpose of diverting people away as much as possible from the Karmapa’s own official websites to your own website? If you sincerely intend to promote his teachings, can’t you simply refer people to his websites by quoting relevant key highlights? How exactly do people learn from the Karmapa when they are nudged to drift farther away from the Karmapa himself? Is this what it looks like – severing people’s pure connection to the Karmapa and hijacking them to become your followers? In your website, you methodically present the Karmapa and his office crew as being inferior to you, what is the point of encouraging people who desire to learn from a lineage guru to hold impure perception, or shall i say suspicion, towards him in general, while viewing you, a self-proclaimed nobody, in a strikingly favorable shade?</p>
<p>How does continual reporting of unverifiable sexual scandals of various lineage gurus in vajrayana buddhism in line with your claim as a dharma translator? How does these help with furthering readers’ genuine spiritual cultivation?</p>
<p>Why defend your gender (female) so ferociously all the time (e.g. underscoring your status as a FEMALE dharma translator in your email to Henry and your website slogan)? Why should people be convinced that Adele Tomlin, <a href="feminism-weaponized.html">supposedly a natural woman, is indeed a woman</a>?</p>
<p>Why blame patriachal system in vajrayana as being sexist/ misogynist/ anti-feminist while out of jealousy, you openly disrespectfully refer ANY other younger looking more beautiful women as dollybirds even prostitutes?</p>
<p>Why paint vajrayana buddhism as corrupt religion full of sex, meat, liquor and wealthy stupid donors, hinting that everyone should give up vajrayana buddhism and convert into worshipping you as a cult idol?</p>
<p>Why eroticize solemn dharma materials into so-called artwork, through images representative of vagina, suggestive wordings, faked unnatural haunting voices in your supposedly sacred dharma music tracks? Are you not committing sacrilege to mix in your erotic moaning and groaning in your <span>“Karmapa Khyenno” music track[3]</span> besides using image representative of vagina as the music cover? Why promote dharma materials through eroticism in this existing oversexualized society? Is this how a traumatized sexual victim would behave? Or an immature nympho unable to regulate sexual compulsion to the point of using dharma to glorify maladaptive sexual dysregulation? Worse, use the dharma as a facade to sell yourself to prospective viewers? Prostitution is a personal choice, but why promote it by exploiting the prominence of the Karmapa and the Buddhadharma and not other more appropriate channels?</p>
<p>Why criticize how Marpa treated Milarepa – the sacred bond of our Kagyu fathers that transcends worldly definition? Their level of bond is unattainable by normal human being. The dynamics of their relationship is strictly due to their cumulative mutual past karmic connection. Why all the pointless judging while the outcome of their unique bond is Milarepa’s incontestable great attainment?</p>
<p>Why <a href="weaponized-morality.html">incessantly work to plant seeds of doubt in readers’ minds towards vajrayana buddhism</a> as an unsafe, corrupt community simply because nobody being obedient to you?</p>
<p>What is your motive in rupturing the father-son relationship between the Dalai Lama and the Karmapa? Why keep bringing up issues of past Gelugpa dominance in Tibet and saying that the Dalai Lama is the true enemy of Tibet – that all lineages should go against the Gelugpa? Who could guarantee what actually occurred in the past while politics is so rife with manipulation and secret plots? When all scores are settled, why lament on past events which unraveled naturally due to past karmic causes-and-effects regardless of who were the TRUE underlying mastermind perpetrators? Why continually look back in resentment instead of look forward to enlightenment? Why all the blame-hate-game in supposedly introspective Buddhist community? Why bring out the worst in readers by inciting hostility, doubt, fear, paranoia, alienation, etc.?</p>
<p>Why keep hinting that the restriction of the Karmapa’s movement is due to jealousy and obstruction from all other lineages within vajrayana buddhism – Nyingma, Sakya, Gelug, including Kagyu (such as Sangye Nyenpa Rinpoche, Kalu Rinpoche, and Karmapa Trinley Thaye Dorje) – yet never quite discloses on what grounds for jealousy? Both the Karmapas have openly express the unanimous stand to unite to serve sentient beings and prevent any divisive attempts to break the Karma Kagyu lineage. Yet, you act against the wish of both the Karmapas, insinuate in every way possible how devotees of Karmapa Ogyen Trinley Dorje should turn against those of Karmapa Trinley Thaye Dorje, besides against those of (Kagyu) Sangye Nyenpa Rinpoche, of (Kagyu) Kalu Rinpoche, of (Nyingma) Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche, of (Sakya) HH Sakya Trizin, and especially of (Gelug) the Dalai Lama, sounding anxiously eager to wipe out the entire traces of vajrayana Buddhism.</p>
<p>Why keep underscoring how the closeness of the Karmapa with the Dalai Lama will ruin his existing cordial relationship with China? Why did the Karmapa have to risk life to escape from Tibet to India if China has been indeed altruistically kind and supportive of his pure Dharma activities? <a href="outsourcing-dangers.html">Why vehemently defend China instead of our irreplaceable authentic lineage gurus</a>?</p>
<p>Who actually benefits the most from readers gullibly buying into these numerous twisted narratives that you present?</p>
<p>And lastly, why give us unwipeable smirk and psychopathic stare in your videos and photos as if to steal our lifeforce?</p>

<p>[2] An <a href="../blog3/audit-mastertable.html">audit of her 899 posts</a> reveals only 7% are translations, even those are compromised. The <a href="../blog3/manipulation-tactics.html">dominant themes of her posts</a> is to incite doubt and hostility: <a href="https://youtu.be/Zpo_xSBC5IM">erode your trust to lineage gurus</a> and program you by persistently exposing your mind to hostility to <a href="https://youtu.be/YUe-kFqM9dY">wage her manufactured wars among lineage sects</a>. This is not surprising given her <a href="../blog3/about.html">Facebook page is documented to run political ads</a> despite claiming as resource for Vajrayana Buddhist translation.</p>
<p>[3] The question is added later after Adele Tomlin published <a href="https://youtu.be/S9m7lX7pIkM">the Karmapa Khyenno song track</a> to <a href="https://youtu.be/UTdnXUH7J7o">silence unresolved questions</a>.

<p><strong>Public Warning</strong>: Mounting evidence of misconduct points to one painful and unavoidable conclusion. Over seven years of operation producing unauthorized dubious translations, Adele Tomlin has been abusing the sacred name of Dakini to infiltrate the Buddhist community and execute anti-Buddhadharma psychological operation to corrupt Vajrayana from within by: advocating twisted views, denigrating (past and present) lineage gurus, disseminating hearsays, seeding conflict, running political ads in coordination with multiple global admins on Facebook. Until statements of accountability are formally issued, association with such a <em>self-endorsed figure (mara) absent authentic lineage authorization</em> guarantees samaya breach, energetic contamination, karmic entanglement, merit dissolution, dualistic imprisonment, klesha accumulation, and spiritual atrophy.</p></div>
