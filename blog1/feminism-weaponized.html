<h1>Feminism Misused to Denigrate Vajrayana Lineage Gurus</h1>
<p>If someone has been advocating paranoia, jealousy, insecurity, judgmental attitudes, even inciting disharmony among Buddhist circles, would any sane readers see that as acceptable? Adele Tomlin (owner of Dakini Translations) would certainly argue, of course it is acceptable with the condition that someone being a woman, especially with the endorsements by various great realized masters as compiled in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250826075350/https://dakinitranslations.com/2024/12/25/dakini-day-christmas-day-festive-offering-e-book-on-female-lineages/">her free ebook</a>, with <a href="https://web.facebook.com/share/p/1QgpYUce5r/">promotion snapshot</a> as below.</p>


<figure><img alt="" src="../images/img_20250512_025208.jpg"/><figcaption>The user Samuel Long on Facebook is one of the most unreasonably devoted worshippers of Adele Tomlin, to the point of having to dig out Adele's old posts and share with the public regularly (aka imprint Adele on your mind).</figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, do you agree with her? She is actually using FOG (Fear, Obligation, Guilt) tactics to gain control over us readers. Since she is using so-called “past realized masters” to endorse such claims, would you not fear, feel obliged, feel guilty going against them as we are “unrealized, less noble beings”? Watch out for these common FOG tactics to spot any unreasonable psychos that make you question your own sanity.</p>
<p>Obviously, we can’t condone any wrongdoing simply because the perpetrator being female. If this was the case, then prisons were only reserved for males and the world would be overloaded with female criminals. Perhaps males would be forced to turn into transwomen to become exonerated? The law must apply equally to all regardless of gender in order to make the world safe.</p>
<p>See? This is just one example of how Adele Tomlin frequently twists authentic Vajrayana teachings by deliberate distortions to turn any contexts possible to favor her as the actual perpetrator, causing readers (especially those unfamiliar) to view negatively of Vajrayana Buddhism as an outrageous religion defying basic common sense.</p>
<p>Her twistedness doesn’t just end there… How about proclaiming herself as a realized dakini that protects the dharma, that we ALL should obey, bow to her, side with her every move, else we are against the Buddhadharma?</p>
<figure><img alt="Maximizing readers’ full compliance, Adele Tomlin proclaims self as realized dakini on her contact page." src="../images/img_20250418_025256.jpg"/><figcaption>Maximizing readers’ full compliance, Adele Tomlin proclaims self as realized dakini on her contact page. Witness the weaponization yourself on <a href="../blog3/contact-page-recoded.html">Dakini Translations and Publications: Contact Page RECODED</a>.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Despite such bold proclamation (or shall we say threaten?), there are not many interested, willing, dumb readers attracted to Adele Tomlin’s repellent qualities – what can be done to maximize the number of followers besides their degree of compliance? How about <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20260203170636/https://dakinitranslations.com/2025/04/06/new-music-video-red-tara-and-land-of-the-sun-music-inspirational-handpan-sounds-and-images/">portraying self as red tara</a> (which actually is mara clothed in red) with its peculiar-shaped hook ready to entrap us readers? This should work much more effectively since red tara is associated with magnetizing quality? Do you know that the hook is never found on any official thangka of red tara, including the one drawn by the Karmapa, but is maliciously added by Adele Tomlin to maximize its ensnaring quality?</p>
<figure><img alt="Demonic mara in disguise, Adele Tomlin posing as red tara to be worshipped and ensnare followers to lower realms." src="../images/demonic-adele-tomlin-posing-as-red-tara-to-ensnare-preys-to-lower-realms.jpg"/><figcaption>Mara clothed in red, Adele Tomlin with hook to ensnare readers into full compliance to its oppressive dungeon.</figcaption></figure>
<p>What does this mean? It means she expects you to visualize her when you pray to red tara. Look how considerate she is to you; even prayer texts have been prepared along with her images for visualization – is this not directing you to worship her as a cult idol, then what is? Now, wouldn’t you feel OBLIGATED to visualize her as your red tara while you use her texts at her website? You hear it right! Devotees of the Karmapa aren’t directed to the official websites of the Karmapa for any prayer texts. Not even a stated disclosure to help readers make informed decisions. The entire structure of presentation is orchestrated in such a manner to cause gullible devotees to assume her texts at her website must be those of the Karmapa. Is this not hijacking the Karmapa’s devotees, then what is?</p>
<p>What could be the ensuing scenarios that play out? <em>When would be the best time to take refuge in Adele Tomlin officially? Go seek her blessings, bow to her, remember to prostrate to her (she loves your physical submission. just as she said Sangye Nyenpa Rinpoche did as she commanded), and ask her to be your root guru; after all you have habitually visualized her as your red tara and she has successfully imprinted herself on your psyche. She has no reason to say no. You are both forever entwined inseparably in fateful demise. No need to seek any other gurus of any vajrayana lineages – they are all choke full of flaws as have been exposed methodically periodically graciously by Adele Tomlin. </em>Would you comply with such endings?</p>
<p>For people who still believe in Adele Tomlin’s sexual allegations against Sangye Nyenpa Rinpoche, ask yourselves…</p>
<p>Between Adele Tomlin and Sangye Nyenpa Rinpoche, which of the two benefit more sentient beings selflessly altruistically unconditionally? Does Sangye Nyenpa Rinpoche ever complain not having enough cash thus hinting you to make donation to him? Does Rinpoche ever outshine past lineage masters by criticizing them how they should have behaved differently?</p>
<p>Which of the two demand your absolute compliance? Does Sangye Nyenpa Rinpoche ever proclaim his human infallibility that you should prostrate to him whenever you meet him and worship him like a God? Does he continually remind you what a superior Bodhisattva he is that you will incur heavy negative karma by going against him? Does Rinpoche ever turn you away or block you simply because you disagree with his views?</p>
<p>Which of the two claim to be superior in knowledge of authentic Vajrayana teachings? Does Sangye Nyenpa Rinpoche ever brag about his academic qualifications, scholarly associations, the many research he has done contributing uniquely to vajrayana buddhism as a whole? Nooo! He says repeatedly whatever he shares with us belongs to all vajrayana lineage masters. He simply repeats what they teach, share with us, that he doesn’t have any unique capacity to say anything new, anything more profound, anything more meaningful to contribute to vajrayana buddhism. Now compare this to Adele Tomlin’s shameless assertion of her outstanding translation/ research/ contribution NEWLY towards vajrayana buddhism, while in truth nothing original at all but cannibalizing others’ works by claiming them all hers! Adding her compulsive sexual preoccupation, as you shall see in few moments, who is likelier to be a sexual predator than a victim?</p>
<p>Are you still not offended by how she treats us readers? You all have big Bodhisattva hearts indeed. Not only am I offended, I am disgusted by her!</p>
<p>I can’t help but wonder why does Adele Tomlin defend her gender so ferociously all the time? Why should people be reminded (else we might forget) that she is a woman? In her confrontational email to Henry, she emphasized her status as a FEMALE dharma translator. Apparently being a dharma translator is not enough, it has to be a FEMALE dharma translator. Then in her website, it is stated as “first female-founded (and sole-authored) online resource for new translations and research on Buddhism and Vajrayana.” Again, it appears just being an online resource is insufficient, it has to be female-founded and sole-authored. Doesn’t it sound as if men were inferior to women, from the way she speaks? Is she a misandrist? Does she see us all as owning primitive “sex sells” mindset? If not, why post numerous photos of herself to flaunt her femininity? We all agree that merit, not gender, is a legitimate ground for any thoughtful argument. Never have I met any women who are this insecure in their gender that they constantly need to convince others so. Is she not a woman? A eunuch? A trans? A hermaphrodite? The amount of her efforts in asserting her gender convinces me otherwise. How about you? Are you convinced? The safest bet is to simply refer her as an “it.”</p>
<p>Infamous for its eagerness to expose ugliness in others in the holy name of protecting the dharma, Adele Tomlin paradoxically censors any dissenting comments that threaten its one-sided unverifiable claims, mostly propelled by deep sense of inadequacy and insecurity, hence pervasive use of presumption of guilt. Overfixation on other people’s ugly sides is a strong sign of sadism, in which the fragile self persistently becomes addicted to make ANY one appear as ugly, inferior, inadequate as possible. Moreover, the only counter-argument against perceptive, disobedient, civilized humans that Adele Tomlin employs is to call us misogynists, sexists, anti-feminists, because sex (and only sex, not the higher mind) is the only means it can think of to conceal its primitive mind full of perversions. Often sounding desperate to initiate sexual contact to steal the life force of Buddhist lamas yet being rejected, it accuses them as sex beasts with many unqualified consorts. (See? Besides destroying disobedient people’s reputation by presuming their promiscuity, it is actually promoting itself as a qualified consort with whom anyone should choose to fornicate.) As a matter of fact, a commenter actually revealed the numerous instances (photos available) Adele Tomlin was caught masturbating during sacred empowerments that the lamas had to announce explicitly “masturbation prohibited during empowerments” to deter it, yet it would contend that the vajra masters in charge of the empowerments were the perpetrators mentally initiating the sexual union. Even though I can’t contact that commenter to provide photos to substantiate the claims, this similar pattern of “being delusionally in sexual union” can indeed be found in <a href="http://www.facebook.com/dakinilove6060">Tsering Wangmo</a>‘s (Adele Tomlin’s) numerous random sex-related posts leaking how it is in orgasmic bliss with denigrating attitude towards Buddhist gurus by sexually objectifying them, such as the Karmapa, as shown in image below.</p>
<img alt="To Adele Tomlin, learning the Buddhadharma which engages the higher mind is perceived as fornicating which engages the lower body, through its incessant objectifying and sexualizing the gurus." src="../images/img_20250512_054029.jpg"/><figcaption>To Adele Tomlin (Tsering Wangmo), listening to sacred Dharma, which engages the higher mind, is perceived as fornicating, which engages the lower body.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Is this how we should treat a lineage guru? Pure devotion inspires respect, never sexual objectification. Ask yourself, can you sexually objectify someone you deeply love, deeply respect, deeply cherish? Adele Tomlin appears to objectify anyone anything anytime; there is no decency whatsoever at its shameless core. Is this not prostituting itself in the name of the Buddhadharma, then what is?</p>
<p>A reader, who prefers to remain anonymous, submitted this photo to prove Adele Tomlin is Tsering Wangmo alongside his intriguing thought:</p>
<figure><img alt="Adele Tomlin often hides in multiple Facebook accounts; one of which is Tsering Wangmo." src="../images/932d0209-d0e7-463a-abdb-86cdde0c7a44.jpeg"/><figcaption>Proof Adele Tomlin is Tsering Wangmo.</figcaption></figure>
<blockquote>
<p>“The ring that she is wearing is the same as the one posted on Tsering Wangmo’s Facebook account, leaving no doubt that Adele is indeed Tsering Wangmo. But this raises the question of why she chooses to conceal her identity behind a Tibetan name while making comments that are derogatory towards Buddhism specially HH Dalai Lama /Gelug.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What could be worse, you think? How about escalating its status to be the secret consort of the Karmapa?</p>
<figure><img alt="Employing FOG tactics, Adele Tomlin converses with itself (another account Wangyal Yuthok) to create a fake picture of someone loyal to its supremacy as the secret consort of the Karmapa, that any of its personal views are the Karmapa’s views." src="../images/img_20250515_022014.jpg"/><figcaption>Employing FOG tactics, Adele Tomlin converses with itself (another account Wangyal Yuthok) to create a fake picture of someone loyal to its supremacy as the secret consort of the Karmapa, that any of its personal views are the Karmapa’s views.</figcaption></figure>
<p>This shameless assertion was posted on its Dakini Translations Facebook page on Apr 23 just after my post “<a href="unresolved-questions.html">Unresolved Questions Pending Adele Tomlin’s Public Statement and Apology</a>” on April 22. As an effective counter-argument, it was saying nobody should question its supremacy, else we were against the Karmapa. (See? It is again using the Karmapa to coerce us into compliance by using the FOG tactics.) Its mentality is merely of deception, blame-shifting and superiority, never even capable of truthfulness, introspection and transparency.</p>
<p>Then without hesitation, on April 25, Adele Tomlin posted a new music track “Karmapa Khyenno” with an image representative of vagina. (See? The typical – sex sells!) This music track was targeted to silence my “unresolved questions” with its alleged “vagina beat” exploiting the Karmapa’s name (i.e. FOG tactics) as if its revolting carnal preoccupation could infect readers to allow primal urges to take over higher minds and we ceased questioning, plummeting to lower realms – how insulting and venomous!</p>
<figure><img alt="Profiting immensely from sensationalism, Adele Tomlin uses image representative of vagina prostituting itself by the “Karmapa Khyenno” music track to silence any critical questioning from readers." src="../images/img_20250512_214503.jpg"/><figcaption>Adele Tomlin uses image representative of vagina prostituting itself by the “Karmapa Khyenno” music track to silence any critical questioning from readers.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Have you listened to its <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rsW1JKeMFSQ">Karmapa Khyenno music track</a>? What do you think of its erotic moaning and groaning? Does “Karmapa Khyenno” deserve to be desanctified and relegated to a mere sex prop by turning it into sexual music to arouse primal urges and encourage listeners, especially the Karmapa’s devotees, to masturbate and even fornicate? Have you noticed how comments are turned off on all its youtube videos? Apparently, Adele Tomlin knows in full certainty its ill-concealed perversion is bound to provoke criticism so comments to all its videos are prohibited to nullify your objection and enforce your full compliance. The inappropriate mixing of solemn dharma materials, that should inspire devotion and respect, with its sexual perversion of denigrating objectifying qualities, is simply distasteful, if not heavy negative karma, to say the least. Still liking its music and videos? Are you endorsing its perversion? Are you not creating the same inescapable heavy negative karma?</p>
<p>You might wonder, why such a questionable character who is sure to provoke criticism possesses quite a number of followers and still attracts likes to its posts? Who knows? But do you know that Facebook followers and likes can be bought at a small price? If it has indeed sufficient number of obedient, loyal, and naive followers…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why does it need to <a href="comments-censored.html">block/ delete dissenting comments</a> to preserve its unquestionable supremacy? Does <a href="https://web.facebook.com/zuck">Mark Zuckerberg</a> ever need to block/ delete dissenting comments?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Why does it need to resort to magic charm by portraying itself as red tara to magnetize preys?</p>
<p>Why does it need to enforce readers’ compliance by using FOG tactics (e.g. using the Karmapa’s name, disgracing feminism, glorifying perversion)?</p>
<p>Why does it need to eroticize solemn dharma materials or wrongfully sexualize religious figures to increase its sensational appeal to the general public?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Why does it need to inundate readers with the same old posts intrusively in facebook groups several times a day, if not every few hours, like an unyielding pest in its desperate attempts to monopolize attention and ensnare new preys?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you know Adele Tomlin is widely disliked and blacklisted in many spaces? How could a <a href="weaponized-morality">malicious psychopath like Adele Tomlin</a> ever forget using the power of “peer pressure” to ensnare people into compliance while the zenith of its vision is to REPLACE the Karmapa himself and wipe out entire traces of authentic Vajrayana Buddhism? Please seriously think about this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>If you are a woman, would you, as a devoted student of the Karmapa, continually remind others of your gender as a female (i.e representing wisdom in vajrayana buddhism) that you are immune to human fallibility, above law and order, and others should unquestionably obey whatever you do or say, else we are against the Karmapa and the Buddhadharma thus incur heavy negative karma?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Would you, as a devoted student of the Karmapa, supposedly also an ex-lawyer, portray him to be guilty of the sexual allegations while the court document indisputably <a href="venomous-vessel.html">proves otherwise</a>? Would you hastily eagerly excitedly announce his guilty position to the public world and humiliate him by judging his every actions, insinuating his promiscuity, demanding him to speak up?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Would you, as a devoted student of the Karmapa, “observe” (i.e. to criticize, to seek flaws, not to reflect nor to learn) his teachings then lay out your “impure perceptions” (i.e. foul propaganda) at the beginning section of your writings and the Karmapa’s teaching transcripts (which are mostly stolen/ copy-pasted from the official websites) at the last section of your writings then share with other devotees to pollute their minds, destroy their pure personal karmic connections with the Karmapa, obstruct their spiritual paths, leading them all to lower realms?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Would you, as a devoted student of the Karmapa, supposedly also a Tibetan dharma translator, vehemently <a href="outsourcing-dangers.html">defend the Chinese government and contemptuously criticize our irreplaceable authentic lineage gurus</a>? Would you go against the Karmapa’s wish to preserve the integrity of Vajrayana Buddhist communities by inciting hostility against other gurus, both within the same lineage (e.g. Karmapa Thaya Dorje, Sangye Nyenpa Rinpoche, Kalu Rinpoche) and other lineages (e.g. Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche, the Sakya Trizin, the Dalai Lama) through carefully framed narratives and “loaded questions” with presumption of guilt, posted repeatedly to contaminate others’ minds with such twisted one-sided unverifiable claims?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Would you, as a devoted student of the Karmapa, denigrate him as a sexual object of your carnal preoccupation, that his live teachings online are capitalized not as sincere engagement with your higher mind but as opportunities to engage with your lower body by compulsive masturbation?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Would you, as a devoted student of the Karmapa, denigrate him publicly by associating your lower genital with the sacred “Karmapa Khyenno” music track through the use of image representative of vagina as the music cover and desanctify the sacred mantra “Karmapa Khyenno,” relegate it to a mere sex prop by incorporating erotic moaning and groaning in the music track?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Would you, as a devoted student of the Karmapa, exploit his prominence, his credibility, his name to back your self-righteous hateful claims, even ask for donations, demand readers’ unquestioning compliance, if necessary, track disobedient ones and silence them?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you can’t ever imagine yourselves ever committing such offences, how would you make of someone capable of executing exactly along those lines for over a decade just to overthrow Vajrayana Buddhism, like Adele Tomlin? Even after exposure to the Karmapa’s extensive teachings on the <em>Fifty Verses on the Guru</em>, it doesn’t appear to learn anything at all despite the calculated pretense in sharing his teachings, as evidenced by its same pattern of denials and contradictions, which leads to the conclusion that the Karmapa is merely exploited as an instrument to further its malicious self-serving agenda. Should we not actively block it from spreading such venomous influence? Would you want to create heavy negative karma by enabling the spread of its venomous influence in the Buddhist circles? Can you think of any legitimate reasons to condone and support Adele Tomlin’s denigration of numerous lineage gurus, especially the Karmapa and the Dalai Lama, by its pervasive <em>presumption of guilt</em>? Adele Tomlin can’t even treat itself with dignity, how is it expected to treat precious vajrayana lineage gurus with dignity? Shouldn’t Adele Tomlin be jailed for committing such grave offences to undermine lineage gurus and overthrow Vajrayana Buddhism?</p>
<p>If life has been overly smooth and too kind to you, readers are welcome to click “follow” Dakini Translations Facebook page to have an unforgettable taste of uninvited mental /psychological /emotional /spiritual abuse or secretly observe its posts by casting your <em>sharp eyes</em>. Do its writings truly elevate your mind or coerce it to replicate its twisted karmic tendencies and fixate on its delusions of grandeur? Would a genuine practitioner be more focused on self-cultivation or other (not one but numerous) people’s ugliness? Do its writings stand by “presumption of guilt” or “presumption of innocence”? Sooner or later, with or without your consent, by feeding your mind daily with its twisted posts, you might just end up worshipping it as your ultimate cult idol, replacing all authentic lineage gurus – definitely what Adele Tomlin has been carefully orchestrating for over a decade to enforce your maximum compliance! You will be extremely (un)fortunate to be blessed directly by such manipulative mara to land in lower realms unobstructedly after deaths for eons to come.</p>

<p><strong>Public Warning</strong>: Mounting evidence of misconduct points to one painful and unavoidable conclusion. Over seven years of operation producing unauthorized dubious translations, Adele Tomlin has been abusing the sacred name of Dakini to infiltrate the Buddhist community and execute anti-Buddhadharma psychological operation to corrupt Vajrayana from within by: advocating twisted views, denigrating (past and present) lineage gurus, disseminating hearsays, seeding conflict, running political ads in coordination with multiple global admins on Facebook. Until statements of accountability are formally issued, association with such a <em>self-endorsed figure (mara) absent authentic lineage authorization</em> guarantees samaya breach, energetic contamination, karmic entanglement, merit dissolution, dualistic imprisonment, klesha accumulation, and spiritual atrophy.</p></div>
