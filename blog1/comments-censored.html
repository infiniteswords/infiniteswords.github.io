<h1>Comments on the 17th Karmapa blocked and deleted</h1>
<p>I have been blocked by Adele Tomlin, the owner of Dakini Translations and Publications, on facebook. My comments on her posts are also deleted. I assume she feel threatened by candid remarks. Any followers of her facebook page beware. She presents a distorted view in which her supremacy rules over free speech. You won’t find any dissenting views on her page. She tends to mix the good Dharma stuff with her toxic vibes in her posts, if you take a closer look. There is no humbleness in her being; a huge giveaway of a highly-strung narcissist. Readers beware. Spiritual practitioners even more so.</p>
<p>Here are my comments to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250618132111/https://dakinitranslations.com/2025/02/27/small-laywoman-gathering-for-17th-karmapas-private-tara-sadhana/">her post in late February 2025</a> regarding the Karmapa’s photos on facebook of Zurmang Kagyu Nepal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I am not clear why Adele you seem to be peculiarly obsessed with the Karmapa. Does micro-zooming nitpicking on everything he does or says promote you fame and recognition you sorely yearn?</p>
<p>After all, you claim yourself as the first female-founded solo-authored online resource for new translations on Buddhism?</p>
<p>You appear to have some serious narcissistic disorder in which you think too highly of yourself. Your tone of words emits an unhealthy grandiose self compared to the rest of us, “less noble” beings, which you presume, that need to be educated or perhaps rehabilitated? I doubt you ever question your sanity? Or you see yourself so flawless that you never have misjudgments, misperceptions nor any failings as humanly as possible.</p>
<p>Why do you assume the Karmapa or anyone has to fit into your idea of what to do and what not to do? Who are you to impose such a patronizing tone on any happenings around the tibetan buddhism? Do you always think and speak this way to anyone, on anything? Is it rational to presume that any phenomena occurring in life must and have to concur with our suppositons? Even a king can’t claim his grandiosity in such irrational manner as you do. Are you not propagating the dualistic view of judging and labeling under the mirage of promoting new translations? Which direction does this kind of habitual lust lead us? liberation of samsara, you suppose?</p>
<p>Self-proclaimed greatness as a noble female practitioner just doesn’t cut it. Your constant criticism towards many things only propels division and unwarranted resentment. No realized being would behave as you for sure. As you said it, “actions speak louder than words,” your actions definitely speak loudly as someone so insecure in their own skin that they have to belittle others and seek flaws in everything around in order to feel and appear superior. You are literally planting worms in people’s heads. Those following your posts should beware of such potential evil psych-op. Reading Adele’s posts gullibly without the awareness of how much harm they might do to your mind is plain suicide to your spiritual progress. All I can see hidden in Adele’s posts is outright self-righteous narcissism.”</p>

<p>Another post I made was quoted from an article on <a href="https://amitabhapath.blogspot.com/2025/02/dont-judge-others-with-dharmic-concepts.html">https://amitabhapath.blogspot.com/2025/02/dont-judge-others-with-dharmic-concepts.html</a>, The Noble Mahāyāna Sūtra Purification of Karmic Obscurations, which was also deleted by her. She obviously doesn’t possess the best interest of genuine spiritual practitioners, but only growing her own exposure at the expense of ruining samaya and harmony among vajrayana lineages.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Noble Mahāyāna Sūtra Purification of Karmic Obscurations</p>
<p>Lord Buddha:</p>
<p>Mañjuśrī, when childish ordinary beings practice generosity, they do it with disrespect toward miserly sentient beings. Due to their disrespect, those who practice giving get angry and give rise to the fault of resentfulness. The faults of anger and resentfulness plunge them into the hell realms.</p>
<p>When childish ordinary beings observe moral conduct they speak ill of those neglecting moral conduct, disparaging and treating them contemptuously. When these disparaging remarks are repeated to others it causes disrespect in many ordinary beings, who will go to the lower realms due to their disrespect.</p>
<p>When they practice patience, they declare, ‘We have patience, while those others bear harmful thoughts.’ Intoxicated with the arrogance of patience, they create all the suffering that results from fundamental heedlessness.</p>
<p>When they exert themselves in diligence, they extol themselves and think, ‘Those other monks are lazy and lack diligence, yet they enjoy the offerings of the faithful. They are not worthy of even enjoying water from a water container.’ As they exert themselves in diligence, they praise themselves and disparage others. I say that they are childish beings.</p>
<p>When they spend their time in the equilibrium of meditation, they give rise to attachment to the joyful bliss of meditation and think, ‘We spend our time in equipoise. Those other monks spend their time in mental distraction. They spend their time enjoying frivolous entertainments. As they enjoy frivolous entertainments, how will they ever become buddhas? They are far from the enlightenment of a buddha.’ Those who take attitudes like these, as long as they think such contemptuous thoughts, will cling tightly to saṃsāra for eons. Later, if they engage in enlightenment, even if they have great learning, they will imagine that, among all letterless phenomena, the mind is existent.</p>
<p>When they observe transcendent awareness they disdain others. I say that they have no knowledge, I say that they talk even though they do not know; I say that they are not sublime beings; I say that as they conceptualize, they are corrupted.</p>
<p>If they enter the Mahāyāna, again they will think, ‘We are foremost in this world, we are the best in this world, we are supreme in this world.’ When they see followers of the Hearers’ Vehicle they give rise to disrespect, disparage them, denigrate them, and speak ill of them. Due to these evil thoughts and condemnations they will be reborn in the lower realms.”</p>

<div class="stamp">
<p><strong>Public Warning</strong>: Mounting evidence of misconduct points to one painful and unavoidable conclusion. Over seven years of operation producing unauthorized dubious translations, Adele Tomlin has been abusing the sacred name of Dakini to infiltrate the Buddhist community and execute anti-Buddhadharma psychological operation to corrupt Vajrayana from within by: advocating twisted views, denigrating (past and present) lineage gurus, disseminating hearsays, seeding conflict, running political ads in coordination with multiple global admins on Facebook. Until statements of accountability are formally issued, association with such a <em>self-endorsed figure (mara) absent authentic lineage authorization</em> guarantees samaya breach, energetic contamination, karmic entanglement, merit dissolution, dualistic imprisonment, klesha accumulation, and spiritual atrophy.</p></div>
