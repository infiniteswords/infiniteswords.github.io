<h1>Hardcore Anti-Karmapa Venomous Vessel: “Dakini Translations” in Action</h1>
<p>An impure vessel that spews out venom, despite whatever precious amrita/ nectar/ dharma being poured in; Adele Tomlin’s pervasive “presumption of guilt” distorts reality so heavily that even any learning of the Buddhadharma is churned into venom, hurting self and others. Such impure perception only blocks herself from receiving authentic lineage guru’s blessings. No matter how many times she intentionally manipulates readers into believing that the Karmapa is her root guru, due to delusions of grandeur, she can’t hide her incoherent thinking, inconsistent personality and incompetency in regulating emotions, maliciously clouding readers’ judgments through her writings.</p>
<p>Adele Tomlin (a mara hiding by the name Dakini Translations) left a comment to the Facebook page author “<a href="https://www.facebook.com/100064589118356/posts/1076777594485201/?mibextid=rS40aB7S9Ucbxw6v">the truth about the false allegations against the 17th Karmapa</a>“- here are my thoughts.</p>
<figure><img alt' vilifying the Karmapa.Contemptuous comment left by Adele Tomlin (Dakini Translations and Publications) to the facebook page author 'the truth about the false allegations against the 17th Karmapa' vilifying the Karmapa as an indisputable promiscuous figure despite court document states otherwise." src="../images/img_20250418_015115.jpg"/><figcaption>Contemptuous comment left by Adele Tomlin (Dakini Translations and Publications) to the facebook page author “the truth about the false allegations against the 17th Karmapa.”</figcaption></figure>
<p><em><sub>“If it is true that the Karmapa has a child with Han, would not your slandering her here be totally wrong? The official court papers that were published online by the court officials, clearly state that the respondent, Dorje admitted that 1 million CAD were transferred to Han via third parties “for the child”. So are you saying the court documents themselves are false? That is a very serious accusation to make of a court of law. Can you prove that?”</sub></em></p>
<p>Even without a law degree, anyone sane and impartial would be able to tell fact from fiction. Nobody EVER says the court document is false as it can be accessed freely openly at <a href="https://www.bccourts.ca/jdb-txt/sc/21/09/2021BCSC0939cor1.htm">https://www.bccourts.ca/jdb-txt/sc/21/09/2021BCSC0939cor1.htm</a>. Yet, Adele Tomlin, who claims to be an ex-barrister, then a translator that deals EXCLUSIVELY with words, can’t even decipher court documents properly (purportedly in her native language as she claims herself as a Brit) and regards ALL stated allegations therein as FACTS, while blatantly dismissing/ carelessly overlooking the background part in the very beginning that reads outright evident:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>[6] It should be emphasized that this is an application to amend pleadings only. The allegations by the claimant are presumed to be true for the purposes of this application. Those allegations have not been tested in a court of law.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What does this show us? Who is making a serious accusation here? Is it intentional on her part to reach such an erroneous verdict? Adele Tomlin once mentioned on her website that she believes in the allegations against the 17th Karmapa Ogyen Trinley Dorje because she was a sexual abuse victim of Sangye Nyenpa Rinpoche herself. If that abuse had taken place, why would she need to so desperately convince the public even by distorting the indisputable truth of the Karmapa being innocent? She obviously chooses to invert the fact only to make her story of Sangye Nyenpa Rinpoche believable. Deep down Adele Tomlin knows it sounds unconvincing that she constantly needs to find ways to solidify her fake pitiable pious persona to gain public acceptance. Speaking in terms of the FOG (Fear, Obligation, Guilt) tactics, she imposes Fear, Obligation and Guilt on us readers so that we support her fully – not only translation work, but also incoherent comments or questions laden with the presumption of guilt, encouraging people to have as much impure perception as possible toward any gurus, particularly lineage gurus. The rationale is simple. To destroy faith, especially a crucial hallmark in Vajrayana Buddhism without which no accomplishment will result, you simply need to nudge that very faith repeatedly enough to cause harm in the long run, subtly enough to sound harmless, brazenly enough (by portraying herself as a modern dakini) to instill Fear and enact the harm insidiously without even anyone realizing it. The entire process is enacted in full force psychologically just by Adele Tomlin’s regularly publishing new translation /compilation texts interspersed with seemingly random (yet unknowingly calculated) posts/ comments/ loaded questions against lineage gurus. You hear me right! Lineage gurus have to be exposed in the eyes of Adele Tomlin. Once a lineage guru is brought down, you can be sure the entire lineage is wiped out. It’s not that I am a conservative, but lineage gurus are unique in Vajrayana Buddhism as the lifeblood of its existence. People, who think of themselves as modernists and are convinced of their own twisted transparency laden with presumption of guilt, should just leave Vajrayana Buddhism respectfully and set up their own cult group separately. Here is just NOT the place for them to enact any modern revolution by fomenting internal discords. People who are following Adele Tomlin’s Facebook page Dakini Translations without any sense of caution initially might find her posts outspokenly entertaining but over time they don’t even realize that their initial pure perception and devotion to gurus have eroded significantly enough to disengage them from any meaningful spiritual cultivation, not by their own intent unfortunately, but by design enacted by someone the public see as weak (i.e. a lone woman as she repeatedly mentions of herself), pitiable (i.e. former sexual abuse victim), devoted (i.e. fervent in promoting the Karmapa’s teachings even to the extent of bossing everyone to support the Karmapa in every way possible else they are enemies of the Kagyu lineage – isn’t such unreasonable sense of entitlement actually harming the Karmapa?). Of course, with such a carefully crafted pious persona, why would anyone be cautious or suspicious of her? All FOG tactics are fully employed here by exploiting the prominence of the Karmapa. Never even once have we questioned whether her overt – even sounding unreasonably aggressive – support for the Karmapa is simply an indispensable script to exploit our sincere intentions. Who do you think would have such tenacity to deter you from achieving enlightenment? The unyielding pest mara, correct!</p>
<p>Are you not offended by how dumb she views us? Would you use her transcribed/ translated texts? Ask yourself… To promote the Karmapa’s teachings, would you compete with his official websites by directing his followers toward your own website? Quoting is fine, but here providing a complete set of re-transcription/ re-translations of your own version, implying the inferiority of the official versions to yours or any other hidden agenda, such as misrepresenting yourself to be officially affiliated to the Karmapa? As seen in the images below, the Wikipedia entry of Vinaya directs the public to Adele Tomlin’s website instead of the Karmapa’s official website, even though the quoting is taken from the Karmapa’s own original teachings. The user Nesjswn5 reports that it has been blocked by Wikipedia from editing any entry until nearly three years from now. Do you think it is pure coincidence to be blocked for a genuine attempt to prevent any potential misrepresentation of the Karmapa’s official platform? The blocking – does it sound familiar to you?</p>


<figure><img alt="In the Wikipedia entry of Vinaya, rather than stating the source as from the official website of the Karmapa, it is referring the public to Adele Tomlin's personal website Dakini Translations." src="../images/IMG_20250608_040205.jpg"/><figcaption>In the Wikipedia entry of Vinaya, rather than stating the source as from the official website of the Karmapa, it is referring the public to Adele Tomlin's personal website Dakini Translations.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Furthermore, how does this sound to you – an ex-lawyer (a devoted student) outspokenly distorts court document interpretation to vilify a lineage head (supposedly its root guru) in Vajrayana Buddhism? Aren’t you fascinated by how far she crosses the line? How insanely devoted to the 17th Karmapa does Adele Tomlin seem to you when she objects to people who present convincing evidence to disprove the false allegations against the 17th Karmapa to the point of ordering them to shut up, accusing them of fabricating lies, and demanding them to disclose their names? See the images at the end for proofs. At this point, do you feel betrayed?</p>
<p>No wonder Adele Tomlin has to put much effort into using AI to portray herself as Red Tara for the magnetizing quality because deep down she knows her unschooled opinionated tainted mind is and will always remain unmistakably repellent to astute readers, thus resorts to magic charm to ensnare preys (readers) to her bleak oppressive dungeon.</p>
<p><em><sub>“Also, you say that the lives of all the people who went against the Karmapa historically ended very badly, so that logic would also apply to the Tibetans themselves, such as the Dalai Lamas and Gelugpas then. Are you not aware of what happened to the 10th, 11th and 12th Karmapas under Gelugpa and Mongolian invasion and takeover of Tibet? They tried to kill 10th Karmapa many times and he had to flee Tibet and live in exile in Lijiang, China for many years.”</sub></em></p>
<p>Why is Adele Tomlin so obsessed with cornering the Dalai Lama and Gelugpas? How does constantly bringing up issues regarding past Mongolian invasion/ Tibet takeover add any value to readers’ personal development? (Regardless true or not because history is complicated – no one can tell for sure what occurred in the past.) How is this sort of historical information practically useful to the brutal reality of our own death? Why would genuine practitioners be concerned with which lineage – Kagyupa, Gelugpa, Sakyapa, Nyingmapa – gets the largest number of devotees? Since when has Vajrayana Buddhism turned to political power contention instead of personal spiritual cultivation? Who could guarantee what actually occurred in the past while politics is so rife with manipulation and secret plots? Why lament on past events that were simply phenomena unraveling naturally due to karmic forces regardless of who were the TRUE underlying mastermind perpetrators? Why all the blame-hate game in the supposedly introspective Buddhist community? Rather than deflecting the point of discussion, Adele Tomlin can simply admit not believing in karmic cause and effect – a non-Buddhist who uses the Karmapa (hijack his teachings and gullible followers) to serve her selfish agenda to be worshipped as our new cult idol – isn’t that some form of revolution?</p>
<p><em><sub>“In any case, who are you? Why are you anonymous? Are you speaking from or on behalf of the 17th Karmapa? You should state clearly who you are before passing judgement on others whose names you post and speak badly of.”</sub></em></p>
<p>How does the anonymity of a piece of writing affect the soundness of its arguments? Being identifiable could often be mistakenly considered as being accountable. But, identifiable authors, such as Adele Tomlin, can prove to be an incompetent twisted thinker who arrogantly demands readers’ unquestioning obedience (going too far as to threaten readers not to oppose her to avoid heavy negative karma by proclaiming herself as realized Dakini – but hasn’t Adele Tomlin admitted not believing in karma just now? Why the double standards?). Nobody is interested in gaining exposure, so why bother disclosing identities? As long as a piece of writing empowers the public to exercise their own independent judgment, except for someone who wishes to silence dissenting views, who cares who the writers are? Why would a lone woman like Adele Tomlin get annoyed and be extremely curious about the names of people who defend a lineage guru? Is she truly a lone woman? What exactly will she do with those names if they get revealed to her?</p>
<h2>Updates June 13, 2025:</h2>
<p>Even though the Facebook page “The truth about the false allegations against the 17th Karmapa” had maintained good standing for many years, very recently on May 25, 2025, it was AGAIN strangely suspended (to date, the third time) due to impersonation claim despite numerous attempts to appeal. A new page has been created <a href="https://web.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61576967636540">Clarifying the Allegations: A Support Page for the 17th Karmapa</a>. Somehow the contents therein to defend a lineage guru were viewed as threatening to certain entities that the page had to disappear. Upon closer look, solid proofs of Adele Tomlin (founder of Dakini Translations) as a hardcore anti-Karmapa are unearthed as she disapproves of any attempts to confirm the 17th Karmapa’s innocence, orders people who are pro-Karmapa to keep quiet, accuses them of fabricating lies, and demands them to reveal their identities. Could she be the culprit behind the page suspension? How could a weak lone woman be capable of such silencing maneuvers? Is she backed by some darker hidden powerful entities to bring destruction to Vajrayana Buddhism, particularly through carefully designed plots to cut us all off from the 17th Karmapa Ogyen Trinley Dorje – physically, emotionally, mental, even spiritually?</p>

<h2>PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL, MENTAL AND SPIRITUAL ALIENATION FROM THE 17TH KARMAPA ORGYEN TRINLEY DORJE BY DESIGN</h2>
<p>It is widely known that some entities have been attempting hard to nail the 17th Karmapa down since his escape from Tibet to India. His whereabouts remain undisclosed so physically we are alienated from him. Then, we are bombarded with rampant online opinions unanimously stating sexual accusations by three women as facts, as if these people were omniscient Gods able to tell past, present and future. One such jarring voice is made by Dakini Translations of Adele Tomlin. Its reports on seeking the Karmapa are written irresponsibly by the presumption of guilt, implying promiscuity, social ineptitude, and a luxurious lifestyle—all of which are carefully worded to doubt the very integrity of an authentic lineage guru. Even the Wikipedia entry of “Ogyen Trinley Dorje” describes the Vikki Han case as facts; any attempts to modify or add information are blocked. (You can try it out yourself. See if your IP addresses are blocked.) We are made to feel deeply hurt for being betrayed by such one-sided narratives, hence emotionally we become alienated from him. For a more balanced view of the Karmapa’s situation, visit <a href="https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/9158032218966544849/5651022304879261312#">truthkarmapa2.blogspot.com</a>, particularly read the articles disproving both <a href="https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/9158032218966544849/5651022304879261312#">out-of-court settlement</a> and <a href="https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/9158032218966544849/5651022304879261312#">DNA test confirmation</a>. The alienation doesn’t just end there because naturally, people with past karmic connections to the Karmapa would still be interested to learn from him, i.e. connecting with him mentally and spiritually. Mental and spiritual aspects are inseparable here because learning from the Karmapa, an authentic lineage guru, can harness our spiritual potential exponentially. Here is how an obnoxious intermediary—Dakini Translations—critically comes into play, supposedly to bridge our connections to the Karmapa, but actually to block them completely. Students with genuine renunciation will notice how different it feels to learn directly from the Karmapa himself compared to an intermediary profuse in hearsay propagation. The latter relentlessly undermines our confidence in the gurus, the Buddhadharma, and the entire Vajrayana Buddhism. Rivaling the Karmapa’s official platforms, comprehensive sets of the Karmapa’s teachings are re-translated or re-compiled in a separate website to appear to be affiliated with the Karmapa. However, no one can tell if these are not copy-pasted from the official websites, and then added with some slight modifications, because they always lag behind the official ones. It works aggressively online to promote its own website through social media to outshine the official websites, posting new materials on Facebook every few days, and on Facebook groups repeatedly every few hours a day, leaving people wonder if it has nothing else going on in life but Facebook. Gullible people simply take it at face value and among those possessing some slight interest in the Karmapa become ensnared in its dungeon by following its page; what can go wrong by following a page promoting the Karmapa’s teachings so selflessly with its unrivaled diligence (i.e. intrusive overly frequent postings)? Here comes the stage in which an uninvited spiritual rehabilitation initiates. Once you successfully complete the rehabilitation, you become fully alienated from the Karmapa and Vajrayana Buddhism.</p>
<p>So, what is the spiritual rehabilitation by being a follower of Dakini Translations?</p>
<ul>
<li>First, you identify with it by belonging to the same Karma Kagyu lineage, bound by the same root lineage guru, the Karmapa. Identification is the first step to pry open your level of receptiveness.</li>
<li>Second, most of its posts are about promoting the Karmapa’s teachings, either texts or short clips. This signals another yes in your mind, opening further your level of receptiveness, accepting it as your dharma friend.</li>
<li>Third, since you find its posts about the Karmapa’s teachings helpful, you begin to approve it in your mind as a sound dharma practitioner. It seems genuine in promoting the dharma especially with active posting every few hours on Facebook group to remind us of the Karmapa’s teachings. Your current level of receptiveness has become wide open with no barriers, turning into complete acceptance and full approval.</li>
<li>Fourth, it suddenly pops up some disturbing news on certain gurus. For brevity, we’ll focus on lineage gurus, such as the Karmapa. Based on the presumption of guilt, she shares with you her speculation of the meanings behind what he does, where, with whom, why and so forth. The themes revolve around promiscuity, social ineptitude, and luxurious lifestyle. At this stage, it is setting an example to your subconscious mind that it is possible to learn from the Karmapa and to doubt his integrity, or to learn the Buddhadharma while casting negative judgments on gurus who propagate the Dharma. You are experiencing cognitive dissonance, a clash of two sides of ideation. Because to you, either we view a person respectfully and learn from him, or we distance ourselves from a corrupt person not worth following. This is the crucial stage where you decide to either unfollow or continue following the page. If you view the Karmapa as an authentic lineage guru, then there is no point in entertaining doubts about him that corrupt your own practice. Besides, if you come to Dakini Translations for the Karmapa’s teachings, why the need to learn from an intermediary if you can trust your own judgment by going to the official websites? Let’s say, you pity its desperate attempts to seek attention by frequent postings, you decide to continue following the page.</li>
<li>Fifth, it continues posting the Karmapa’s teachings as usual. You begin to wonder, didn’t she just view him negatively? But she still posts his teachings, which means she still is respectful towards him. Maybe her prior remarks were just plain curiosity, nothing remotely serious or doubtful. Notice how you are questioning your own sanity due to the high level of receptiveness to its posts prepped from stage one to stage three prior, and now rationalizing in dealing with cognitive dissonance. As a normal human being, you adapt by rationalization when you cannot tamper with either side of the dissonance equations. In this case, by being a follower of the Dakini Translations page, you surrender your freedom of choice and let it impose its perverted choice on you; you cannot choose to either abandon the Karmapa or view him completely positively. Dakini Translations will never abandon the Karmapa because he is the most lucrative source for exploitation to maximize donation earnings. It will also never view him purely positively because its goal is to replace him; at least in your mind, you will see it as superior to all lineage gurus in every way possible – a realized dakini who protects the teachings, and you should be careful not to go against her as she aptly warns because you are not enlightened to tell who is who! Well, do you think a true bodhisattva or a real dakini will easily leak her identity to the public? What for? Their ultimate purpose is selfless service, not enforcing compliance nor gaining respect, which by the way is essentially what a mara would be particularly obsessed with! But it doesn’t simply end there. You hardly notice that such an unyielding pest always slips in its personal observations (not reflections!) whenever sharing its versions of the Karmapa’s teachings and places the teaching transcripts at the very end, ripping you off the opportunity to construct your own meanings, wiping off your personal meanings, superseding them with its impure interpretations, thus forcing you to assimilate its views without you even knowing. Your mere consumption of its seemingly Dharma posts amounts to your drinking venom mixed with amrita, let alone its fully toxic non-Dharma hearsay propagation. As long as you remain associated with Dakini Translations, its venom influx will continue to act full force under your radar without your consent. At this stage, subconsciously you have condoned its blatant denigration of the gurus, disguised cunningly under the harmless label of critical thinking, while in reality, your doubts and suspicions are being meticulously groomed to blossom steadily by siding with its presumption of guilt.</li>
<li>Sixth, it repeats the cycles of stages four and five. Any remarks on stage four are meant to erode your confidence in any gurus in Vajrayana Buddhism. Even though, you think you learn from its posts on the Buddhadharma including the Karmapa’s teachings, somehow deep down, you have well assimilated its presumption of guilt paradigm through your own adaptive rationalization that you can no longer view anything related to the Buddhadharma with pure lenses but cynicism. Before you realize it, you begin to truly notice the disintegrity of all lineage gurus, that they are just humans full of flaws, what else can we expect from anyone like ourselves? At this point, you view gurus as the same as everyone else, plain humans who mouth past masters’ teachings, nothing special. Be assured that your spiritual path is forever blocked, with no progress down the road despite how much you practice. Congratulations, you have successfully undergone total spiritual atrophy – not rehabilitation as it turns out! Shouldn’t you celebrate by kneeling to mara Adele Tomlin and kissing her toes? What has it done to you? How gracious is it to bestow such irreparable damage to your spiritual destiny!</li>
</ul>
<p>The presumption of guilt is a dangerous crippling mindset to embrace. When you begin to see the flaws of someone, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to unsee the flaws. This is largely due to a phenomenon called confirmation bias in psychology; we usually accept reality the way we want it to be, not the way it actually is. No matter how many pieces of convincing evidence I present to you that our lineage gurus are pure and innocent, if you inherently presume people to be evil and guilty, our arguments inevitably stand moot as our viewpoints diverge farther away from each other. The way you see it things are rotten to the core! The way I see things can never be any purer! I see you being a cynic. You see me being in denial. Viewpoints are essentially tight to our sense of self. Some people feel secure by uncovering the flaws in others. Some people feel secure by learning from others’ innumerable positive qualities. Both are valid, but which viewpoint leads to a sense of growth and utter fulfillment? I will leave it to you to decide. In psychology, some images can be interpreted differently yet validly at the same time. For example, depending on your personal inclination, what animal do you see in this image?</p>
<figure><img alt="depending on your dominant imprint, this image can be validly viewed as two completely different animals." src="../images/images-1.jpeg"/><figcaption>Two different animals can be validly seen by the mind, <a href="https://www.technologynetworks.com/neuroscience/news/decoding-ambiguity-context-is-crucial-298329#">depending on viewpoints</a>.</figcaption></figure>
<p>As mind is the subject of transformation, in your quest for enlightenment in Vajrayana Buddhism, you only have two choices: to trust or to abandon. There is no in-between. The in-between is essentially the same as abandon. Based on past historical enlightening stories, such as the unbelievable story of Milarepa and Marpa, only those who place absolute faith in the authentic gurus achieve supreme attainment. We do not condone any misdeeds done in the mask of being a guru, because there are indeed many fake gurus and lamas. The Fifty Verses on the Gurus taught by the Karmapa (available freely on his official websites <a href="http://aryakshema.com/">aryakshema.com</a> or <a href="http://kagyuoffice.org/">kagyuoffice.org</a>) will be especially helpful for us to be more discerning. But carrying a cynical mindset to judge an authentic lineage guru, such as the 17th Karmapa Ogyen Trinley Dorje, essentially means you don’t trust the nearly-a-thousand-year-old Karma Kagyu lineage enough to trust the very person who preserves and propagates the lineage. If you choose to give in to whatever appears or sounds to be convincing – and yes, all appearances can be orchestrated – rather than probe within and trust your inner wisdom to discern what lies beneath all these appearances, you are vulnerably subjecting yourself to covert manipulation by any hidden external entities. Life is a spiritual domain requiring your courageous re-attunement to the long-stifled inner voice, not a worldly arena distracting your attention to the most eye-catching loudness. If you believe lineage gurus are ordinary humans irrelevant to your spiritual progress – that you are the sole master of your spiritual destiny and you need no one – I am not here to convince you otherwise, perhaps it is time to seriously consider leaving Vajrayana Buddhism respectfully rather than destroy the entire lineage. Why the need to be jealous of and stop other people who can have pure perception towards lineage gurus, benefit from their pure devotion, receive authentic blessings and attain supreme enlightenment? If you believe lineage gurus are indispensable to awaken your spiritual potential, doesn’t your heart ache to know our irreplaceable guru, the 17th Karmapa Orgyen Trinley Dorje, is distanced from you not by choice but by design? My heart bleeds as I pour this all out to you… Nevertheless, your karmic link with the Karmapa is boundlessly unstoppable, transcending time and space. It’s time to take back your own power by trusting your inner voice. Connect with the Karmapa directly. Revitalize your heart link with the Karmapa by opening up to him – talk to him, confide in him, feel him, sense him, ask him, and most importantly, trust him. All the important answers you have been seeking will reveal themselves in time. Be patient. Be perceptive. Be assured that you are in safe hands. Karmapa Khyenno!</p>

Over seven years of operation producing unauthorized dubious translations, Adele Tomlin has been abusing the sacred name of Dakini to infiltrate the Buddhist community and execute anti-Buddhadharma psychological operation to corrupt Vajrayana from within by: advocating twisted views, denigrating (past and present) lineage gurus, disseminating hearsays, seeding conflict, running political ads in coordination with multiple global admins on Facebook. Until statements of accountability are formally issued, association with such a <em>self-endorsed figure (mara) absent authentic lineage authorization</em> guarantees samaya breach, energetic contamination, karmic entanglement, merit dissolution, dualistic imprisonment, klesha accumulation, and spiritual atrophy.</p></div>
