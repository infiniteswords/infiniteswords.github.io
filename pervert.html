<h1>Promoting Spiritual Downfall by Objectifying Lamas and Sexualizing Sacred Symbols: The Sex Pest Disguised as Dharma Translator</h1>
<p>If there is one quality above all in Adele Tomlin, it is fearlessness—or perhaps an obsessive anticipation of hell realms—manifested in her relentless desanctification of sacred symbols through sexualization. She published the Karmapa Khyenno song track, mixing sacred mantra with erotic moaning, to silence unresolved public questioning in late April 2025. Throughout her public writings, this nympho unflinchingly portrays Vajrayana transmissions and empowerments in sexualized terms, reducing sacred practice to erotic spectacle and misleading readers into believing that Vajrayana is a sexualized path. <em>A distortion masquerading as insight: this is desecration glorified.</em></p>
<ul><li>Offence: <a href="blog1/persistent-sexualization.html">Public sexual act framed as sacred attainment</a>, performed during empowerment. In simpler terms, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250908082909/https://dakinitranslations.com/2025/08/28/hearing-the-inner-bliss-voice-of-the-buddha-nature-within-9th-gyalton-rinpoche-in-prague-2025/">Adele Tomlin publicly masturbates during sacred empowerments</a>, disregarding confrontation by center staff, and unapologetically flaunts this grotesque act in public writings on Dakini Translations and Publications to gaslight dissenters.</li>
<li>Mechanisms of Depravity:</li>
<ul><li>
Non-consensual objectification – reducing the lama to a sexual prop without his consent.</li>
<li>
Consent forgery – twisting silence into false endorsement.</li>
<li>
Authority hijacking – exploiting his status to cloak misconduct in borrowed legitimacy.</li>
<li>
Sacral fraud – laundering sexual indulgence as tantric realization.</li>
<li>
Audience violation – forcing fellow practitioners to witness desecration of a sacred rite.</li>
<li>
Brainwashing reinforcement – conditioning followers to accept abuse as “profound” and dissent as ignorance.</li>
</ul>
<li>Consequences:</li>
<ul><li>
Lama’s dignity violated.</li>
<li>
Sacred ritual desecrated.</li>
<li>
Observers destabilized, pressured to reinterpret revulsion as “spiritual teaching.”</li>
<li>
Followers deeper entrapped: doubt becomes sin, submission becomes virtue.</li>
<li>
Acts of sexual misconduct under the guise of Dharma generate heavy karmic debt.</li>
<li>
Deception in the name of tantra is a vajra hell offence — uniquely destructive.</li>
<li>
Such patterns create unbroken causes for rebirth in lower realms without exception.</li></ul>
<li>Verdict: This is not tantra. It is <em>sexual exploitation, psychological coercion, and karmic self-destruction.</em> Far from attainment, it guarantees spiritual downfall.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Systematic Undermining of Teacher-Student Trust</h2>
<p>Combining <a href="index.html">unauthorized republication</a>, <a href='blog1/sectarian-poison.html'>biased framing</a>, and <a href='blog1/scaled-moaned.html'>sexualized reinterpretation</a>, Adele Tomlin erodes the essential trust between teacher and student that Vajrayana relies upon. This repeated pattern conditions the public to perceive authentic teachers as impure, while normalizing its distortions as credible insight. This is grooming, not devotion. The outcome is <em>inevitable spiritual atrophy.</em></p>
<h2>Legal Framework Does Not Deter Obsessive Sex Pest</h2>
<p>Public lewdness can be considered a crime, a form of sexual harassment and sexual violence, because it is forced upon unwilling viewers. When the secular world prohibits such indecency, the obsessive sex pest can still invent mythic excuses to invade sacred spiritual spaces. If you think this is crude, how about proliferating in-person invasion to digital spaces via public writings, promoted by paid advertising too on Facebook? The ambitious pervert just won't spare any one — near or far — from its spread of depravity! Its mission has never been about propagating the Dharma, but downfall.
      </p>
<h2>Authentic Standard</h2>
<p>Vajrayana’s inner yogas are not public theatre. Their sacred language is not a cover for exhibitionism. Transmission protects students by preserving precision, permission, and context. Any teaching presentation that begins by sexualizing the lama or the empowerment is already degrading the transmission. Without hesitation, Adele Tomlin exploits the Buddha Dharma to glorify base compulsions, poisoning the public mind and misleading others into equating sexual indulgence with the spiritual path. Dakini Translations and Publications is never a Dharma platform; it is a <a href='blog2/predator.html'>predatory, remorseless, shameless impostor</a> seeking to infiltrate and destroy authentic Buddhist study and practice. <a href="blog1/camera-fear.html">When it fails to colonize spaces for public desecration in Dharma centers</a>, it rallies public hate under the pretext of defending <a href='blog1/proving-lone.html'>a weak lone white woman — too predictable!</a> The antagonistic mara never misses an opportunity to propel spiritual downfall across every encounter. May you never cross its venomous path or be used to enact its overblown dramas!</p>

<div class="stamp">
<p><strong>Public Warning</strong>: Mounting evidence of misconduct points to one painful and unavoidable conclusion. Over seven years of operation producing unauthorized dubious translations, Adele Tomlin has been abusing the sacred name of Dakini to infiltrate the Buddhist community and execute anti-Buddhadharma psychological operation to corrupt Vajrayana from within by: advocating twisted views, denigrating (past and present) lineage gurus, disseminating hearsays, seeding conflict, running political ads in coordination with multiple global admins on Facebook. Until statements of accountability are formally issued, association with such a <em>self-endorsed figure (mara) absent authentic lineage authorization</em> guarantees samaya breach, energetic contamination, karmic entanglement, merit dissolution, dualistic imprisonment, klesha accumulation, and spiritual atrophy.</p></div>
